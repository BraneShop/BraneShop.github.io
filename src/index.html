  <div id="about-us">
    <p>We're here to help you understand and adopt AI.</p>

    <p> At the Braneshop, we love all things AI. We spend our time bringing
    diverse people into the field, and removing the barriers for those that
    have faced them, so that the resulting technology better reflects our
    communities, and addresses <em>all</em> our needs.
    </p>

    <p> We know that AI can be used for amazing things, but also that there
    are many problems and potential solutions that won't be discovered unless
    <em>everyone</em> is involved.
    </p>

    <p>This is our vision: the powerful capabilities of AI in the hands of
    us all.
    </p>

    <p>
    We specialise in teaching these techniques in an intuitive and hands-on
    way. Our workshops are organised in a group setting and learning takes
    place through a mix of theory and practice.

  <h3> <span>üèù Dive into a Workshop! </span> </h3>

  <p> We have a two-pronged approach to AI education: <em>technical</em> and
    <em>strategic</em>. Below are our upcoming workshops that focus on these
    areas.

  <h3> <span>üåà Our Values</span> </h3>
  <blockquote>"AI has the capability of providing something for everybody, only
  because, and only when, it is created by everybody.‚Äù  
  ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a>
  <small>(She said "cities" instead of "AI", but it's well-expressed!)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <div id="values-list">
    <div class="value" id="value-1">
      <h4> Empathy & Ethics </h4>
      <p> The software we write and algorithms we deploy will affect
          people. We aim to be aware of potential impacts and create
          a culture of empathetic ethical engineering.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-2">
      <h4> Community & Diversity</h4>
      <p> We want to create a positive impact in our local
          community. We believe that change is best driven
          locally, upwards.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-3">
      <h4> Empowerment </h4>
      <p> Skills allow for empowerment and can yield
      independence. By building technical skills, we
      hope to enable others to make the kind of change
      they want to see; change that benefits them and
      their community.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-4">
      <h4> Happiness </h4>
      <p> Learning should be fun! We want people to come
          away from this workshop feeling excited, 
          happy and motivated to implement new
          systems and processes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-5">
      <h4> Adaptability </h4>
      <p> Each group of people comes to the Braneshop
      with different skills, interests and abilities. We
      aim to be adaptable to the groups we get, to engage
      with each individual on a personal level, and present
      the material in a way that is meaningful, 
      relatable and intuitive.
