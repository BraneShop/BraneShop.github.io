      <h4> Empathy &amp; Ethics </h4>
      <p> The software we write and algorithms we deploy will affect
          people. We aim to be aware of potential impacts and create
          a culture of empathetic ethical engineering.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-2">
      <h4> Community &amp; Diversity</h4>
      <p> We want to create a positive impact in our local
          community. We believe that change is best driven
          locally, upwards.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-3">
      <h4> Empowerment </h4>
      <p> Skills allow for empowerment and can yield
      independence. By building technical skills, we
      hope to enable others to make the kind of change
      they want to see; change that benefits them and
      their community.

      <h4> Happiness </h4>
      <p> Learning should be fun! We want people to come
          away from this workshop feeling excited, 
          happy and motivated to implement new
          systems and processes.

      <h4> Adaptability </h4>
      <p> Each group of people comes to the Braneshop
      with different skills, interests and abilities. We
      aim to be adaptable to the people we work with, to engage
      with each individual on a personal level, and present
      the material in a way that is meaningful, 
      relatable and intuitive.

    <div class="value" id="value-6">
      <h4> Technical Excellence </h4>
      <p> 
      Programming is how we build deep learning networks, and as such we
      believe it is important to ensure that they way we write and structure
      the code is of a high quality. We spend a lot of time making sure that
      we communicate ideas in code through strong coding practices, which
      ensures that students have a strong foundation on which to build future
      projects.
