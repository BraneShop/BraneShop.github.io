  <p> You will learn how to build, manage, and support AI teams: The people
      and roles required, and the skills need to build production-scale
      capabilities.
  </p>
  <p> We will cover the most effective AI algorithms; the kinds of data
    that they require, as well as the cutting edge: What areas are researchers
    focusing on, and what are the fields and technologies to watch.
  </p>
  <p> We wrap up with how to measure the progress of AI systems; what
  kinds of promises and guarantees can we make, and what are the risks?

  <h3> <span>üåà Our Values</span> </h3>
  <blockquote>"AI has the capability of providing something for everybody, only
  because, and only when, it is created by everybody.‚Äù  
  ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a>
  <small>(She said "cities" instead of "AI", but it's well-expressed!)</small>

  <div id="values-list">
    <div class="value" id="value-1">
      <h4> Empathy & Ethics </h4>
      <p> The software we write and algorithms we deploy will affect
          people. We aim to be aware of potential impacts and create
          a culture of emapthetic ethical engineering.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-2">
      <h4> Community & Diversity</h4>
      <p> We want to create a positive impact in our local
          community. We believe that change is best driven
          locally, upwards.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-3">
      <h4> Empowerment </h4>
      <p> Skills allow for empowerment and can yield
      independence. By building technical skills, we
      hope to enable others to make the kind of change
      they want to see; change that benefits them and
      their community.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-4">
      <h4> Happiness </h4>
      <p> Learning should be fun! We want people to come
          away from this workshop feeling excited, 
          happy and motivated to implement technology
          systems.
      </p>

    <div class="value" id="value-5">
      <h4> Adaptability </h4>
      <p> Each group of people comes to the BraneShop
      with different skills, interests and abilities. We
      aim to be adaptable to the groups we get, to engage
      with each individual on a personal level, and present
      the material in a way that is meaningful in order
      to develop and reinforce understanding.
