    <h5>Why this format over an online course?</h5>
    <p> There are two main aspects: firstly, if online courses are an
    effective system for you, or for learning this particular field, then we
    encourage you to continue on that front! A couple of resources we
    like are: <a href="https://fast.ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fast.ai</a>, and
    <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">neural networks
      and deep learning</a>, but there are many others.
    </p>
    <p> The second aspect is that we've found there are some significant benefits
    for learning in a small group, namely:
    </p>
    <ul class="normal">
      <li>Ability to clarify confusion directly dramatically speeds up
        learning, and also builds confidence,
      </li>
      <li>
        Exploratory nature of the workshop allows for supervised
        experimentation,
      </li>
      <li>Collaboration with other students significantly increases engagement
        and thus retention of knowledge,
      </li>
      <li>Building a local community enriches everyone, and allows for
        connections and learning to be established outside of the workshop
        itself,
      </li>
      <li>Direct access to <a href="/team.html">trainers</a> allows the teaching and interaction to be
        adapted to the present students, and the specific areas of
        clarification that they may require,
      </li>
      <li>Discussions with our <a href="/team.html">trainers</a>, who are industry experts,
        allows students to learn more than what's directly in the course
        syllabus, such as industry best practices, handy tools, and other
        aspects of AI and deep learning.
      </li>
    </ul>
