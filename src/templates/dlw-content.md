<p> Venture into AI and deep learning with this two-day workshop. You will
be taken from the mathematical and theoretical foundations, to building models
and neural networks in TensorFlow. </p>

<p> You will apply as you learn, working on exercises throughout in
a supportive and collaborative environment. </p>

<p> The second day is group projects centered around implementing
deep learning models in TensorFlow.  </p>
