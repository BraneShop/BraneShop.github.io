<p> Venture into AI and deep learning with this two-day workshop. You will
    be taken from the mathematical and theoretical foundations, to building
    models and neural networks in TensorFlow.
</p>
<p> You will apply as you learn, working on exercises throughout the
    workshop. To enhance learning, a second day is dedicated to 
    applying your new skills in team project work.
