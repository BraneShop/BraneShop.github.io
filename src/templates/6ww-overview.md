<p> Over <b>6 weeks</b>, with <b>3 contact hours per week</b>, you will get to
grips with using Python, TensorFlow and Google Colaboratory.  Our experienced
instructors will work closely to support you to build your own deep learning
models that solve problems across typical domains of deep learning. The
workshop series focuses on foundations, embeddings, and computer vision.

<p> Over <b>6 weeks</b>, we will work with you to support you building your own
deep learning models that to solve problems across typical domains for deep
learning such as computer vision and natural language processing.
</p>

<p> We will begin with the fundamentals: Where is deep learning appropriate,
what is the best ways to think about it intuitively.</p>

<p> Our driving example will be the autoencoder: an idea that unifies
many important concepts in deep learning.  </p> 

<p> We will progress, through a series of hands-on projects and exercises,
cementing the knowledge we gain each week, working our way towards
implementing our own deep learning models, and training them, in TensorFlow
and the Google CoLaboratory.</p>
