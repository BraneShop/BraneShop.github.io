<p> In this one-day intensive session, we will cover everything that you need
to know in order to build AI into your business. This course is for those
looking to: build an internal AI capability, engage a consultancy to build
an AI product, or for those wanting an understanding of best-practice AI
adoption.</p>

<p> We'll go over all the State of the Art in machine learning across a
variety of applications, from text analysis, computer vision, to maps, and
graphs, and audio; we'll see what kinds of data you can use to get started,
and how to bootstrap the process so that you can get started sooner. </p>

<p> We'll cover how the multitude of ways AI can be adopted into your
business; from internal teams and their makeup, to external services, from
model, web to back-end APIs, and devices deployed at the "edge". We'll cover
the adoption path, what risks to watch out for, and how to mitigate them. </p>

<p> We'll wrap up with an investigation into how AI systems make mistakes, and
how these differ from the kinds of mistakes humans make, and how to mitigate
the risks involved, as well as the ethics of AI, and how to implement AI
systems responsibly. </p>
