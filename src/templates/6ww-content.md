<p> <em>A six-week hands-on machine learning workshop for programmers and data
scientists wanting to break into the AI industry.</em> </p> </p>


<p> Over <b>6 weeks</b>, with 3 contact hours per week,  you will get to grips with using Python,
TensorFlow and Google Colaboratory.  Our experienced instructors will work
closely to support you to build your own deep learning models that solve
problems across typical domains of deep learning.  The workshop series
focuses on foundations, embeddings, and computer vision.

<p> Over <b>6 weeks</b>, we will work with you to support you building your own
deep learning models that to solve problems across typical domains for deep
learning such as computer vision and natural language processing.
</p>

<p> We will begin with the fundamentals: Where is deep learning appropriate,
what is the best ways to think about it intuitively.</p>

<p> Our driving example will be the autoencoder: an idea that unifies
many important concepts in deep learning.  </p> 

<p> We will progress, through a series of hands-on projects and exercises,
cementing the knowledge we gain each week, working our way towards
implementing our own deep learning models, and training them, in TensorFlow
and the Google CoLaboratory.</p>
-->

<p> In order to support learning and development, we provide "<b>office
hours</b>", twice per week, for a total of 2 hours, to allow for a supportive
environment to complete assigned homework and gain further understanding. </p>

<h5>*Scholarship</h5>

<p> There is a <a
href="https://ainowinstitute.org/discriminatingsystems.pdf">crisis of
diversity within field of AI</a>. In response to this issue, we are
supporting up to 10 diversity tickets, which are discounted down to <b>$$540
per person</b>, to improve the representation of marginalised and
under-represented groups.
</p>

<p>Applications to this scholarship for the next workshop will open soon;
please subscribe to the newsletter for announcements.</p>
