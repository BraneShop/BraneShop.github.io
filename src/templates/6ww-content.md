<p> <em class="tag">A hands-on deep learning workshop for those looking to
use AI in their projects.
</em> </p>

<h5>About</h5>

<p> Run over about 6 weeks, through this <b>self-paced</b> workshop, you
will get to grips with deep learning through Python, TensorFlow and Google
Colaboratory.  This is a hands-on technical workshop, with a substantial
programming component. </p>

<p>
Due to COVID-19, and the current laws and guidelines around social distancing,
this workshop will be run <b>online</b> in the following way:
</p>

<ul class="normal">
<li>Content will be released to you week by week,</li>
<li>At your own pace, read through the content and attempt the exercises,</li> 
<li>At end of each week, we'll have an hour-long one-on-one with an instructor, to
go over any questions on the material, the homework, or anything else that
comes up,
</li>
<li>The workshop culminates in the completion of all the exercises and
content, and a final discussion outlining where to from here.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our intention is to maintain our high standard of personal
attention through these one-on-one sessions.
</p>


<h5 class="s">What can you expect to receive and achieve?</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>An intuitive understanding of deep learning and the essential concepts,</li>
<li>Hands-on work in solving problems,</li>
<li>Experience building models for typical domains of deep learning: understanding images,
  videos, and text,</li>
<li>Individual support through one-on-one sessions,</li>
<li>Completed a selection of projects in TensorFlow,</li>
<li>A supportive and growing community during and after the workshop.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="s">As part of the process we will ...</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>Consolidate your knowledge through exercises,</li>
<li>Check-in regularly, through one-to-one video calls,</li>
<li>Adjust the content to your interests and abilities, as we go.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="s">Who's it for?</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>Data scientists wishing to move into AI and deep learning,</li>
<li>Programmers looking to build, work with, or otherwise work with AI or deep learning projects,</li>
<li>and broadly, technical people looking to break into the AI industry,
  develop a new business or product, join an existing AI team, or generally
  contribute to the AI ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We welcome people from a variety of backgrounds. To ensure success in the
workshop, a minimum level of Python programming is required, but this is
self-assessed, using <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/VncQkZLylzh8JWez1">this
quiz</a>.

<h5>Tickets</h5>

<p> As this is an online workshop and run <b>individually</b>, in order to get
started we ask everyone to set up a free initial chat with one of our
instructors. 

The aim of this call is to understand your background, learning goals, and work out where
is a good place to start, and what a good rhythm for working together.
