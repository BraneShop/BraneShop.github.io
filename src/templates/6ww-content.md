<li>Hands-on work in solving problems,</li>
<li>Experience building models for typical domains of deep learning: understanding images,
  videos, and text,</li>
<li>Individual and group support,</li>
<li>Completed a selection of projects in TensorFlow,</li>
<li>A supportive and growing community during and after the workshop.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h5 class="s">Who's it for?</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>Data scientists wishing to move into AI and deep learning,</li>
<li>Programmers looking to build, work with, or otherwise work with AI or deep learning projects,</li>
<li>and broadly, technical people looking to break into the AI industry,

</ul>
<p>
We welcome people from a variety of backgrounds. To ensure success in the
workshop, a minimum level of Python programming is required, but this is
