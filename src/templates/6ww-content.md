<p> <em>A six-week hands-on machine learning workshop for
those wanting to break into the AI industry.</em> </p>
<h5>About</h5>

$partial("templates/6ww-overview.md")$

<p> Knowledge is consolidated through each week of teaching enabling
participants to build on work from previous weeks, group discussions, and
homework. In order to support learning and development, we also provide
"<b>office hours</b>" once per week: a supportive environment in which to
complete assigned homework and solidify understanding. </p>
 
<p> At the end of the workshop series participants will have a showreel of
completed projects to demonstrate their ability. </p>

<h5>Who's it for?</h5>
<p>
Those wanting to break into the AI industry. We welcome people from a variety
of backgrounds. To ensure success a minimum level of Python programming is
required, and this is assessed in a prerequisite assessment.
</p>
