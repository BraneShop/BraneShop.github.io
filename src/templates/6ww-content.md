<p> <em class="tag">A hands-on deep learning workshop for those looking to
use AI in their projects.
</em> </p>

<h5>About</h5>

<p> Over an intensive <b>two days</b>, and a subsequent afternoon session, you
will get to grips with deep learning through Python, TensorFlow and Google
Colaboratory.  This is a hands-on technical workshop, with a substantial
programming component. </p>

<p>The workshop is limited to <b>a small amount of people per class</b>. This allows the presentation
can be specific to the audience, and the session to be highly interactive and
targeted. </p>

<h5 class="s">What can you expect to receive and achieve?</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>An intuitive understanding of deep learning and the essential concepts,</li>
<li>Hands-on work in solving problems,</li>
<li>Experience building models for typical domains of deep learning: understanding images,
  videos, and text,</li>
<li>Individual and group support,</li>
<li>Completed a selection of projects in TensorFlow,</li>
<li>A supportive and growing community during and after the workshop.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="s">As part of the process we will ...</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>Have group discussions and learn together in a collaborative way,</li>
<li>Consolidate your knowledge through exercises,</li>
<li>Provide <em>additional</em> support (other than teaching hours) through office hours.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="s">Who's it for?</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>Data scientists wishing to move into AI and deep learning,</li>
<li>Programmers looking to build, work with, or otherwise work with AI or deep learning projects,</li>
<li>and broadly, technical people looking to break into the AI industry,
  develop a new business or product, join an existing AI team, or generally
  contribute to the AI ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We welcome people from a variety of backgrounds. To ensure success in the
workshop, a minimum level of Python programming is required, but this is
self-assessed, using <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/VncQkZLylzh8JWez1">this

<h5>*Scholarship</h5>

<p> There is a <a target="_blank"
href="https://ainowinstitute.org/discriminatingsystems.pdf">crisis of
diversity within the field of AI</a>. We know that members of marginalised
groups face barriers to entry and success within AI, and related fields. To
improve the representation of marginalised and under-represented groups in our
workshop, and community, we are supporting up to 10 diversity tickets, which
are discounted 50%.
