    "I loved all the examples of AI in real life and I also found the
    activity of working through the framework as a team on the example we
    had. it has helped me understand the type of 'thinking' and
    'questioning' that needs to take place specifically for AI that's
    different for other forms of tech. I also loved all the simple and
    powerful visual diagrams in the workshop content.  [...]
    Personally I have a much greater understanding of AI and the role it can
    play in organisations and the opportunity ahead. Professionally I have
    more clarity on how to move forward with helping organisations adopt AI
    from a people change perspective."

    "It's been wonderful to spend more time with Braneshop and [...]
    learning about the different types of leaders out there wanting to
    tackle AI!
    [...]
    The first part was particularly great, going through at a fast pace the
    types of examples of different AI case studies, particularly the
    machine-vision ones [...]"

    "It's given me a greater understanding of AI and the way I can implement
    it in my business including some of the challenges.
    [...]
    It really challenged me to think outside the square! There's a lot of
    thought that goes into designing an ai system which I was unaware of.
    From UX to the business side, a lot needs to be considered. The group
    exercises really helped break this down.
