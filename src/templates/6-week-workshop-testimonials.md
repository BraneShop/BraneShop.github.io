    "The team at Braneshop create a learning environment that is such a pleasant
    contrast to anything I've experienced at university. Ruth and Noon, with the
    help of Esmeralda, create a safe and inclusive space to learn, free of
    pressure or judgement. Without scrimping on technical details, they manage to
    keep a lighthearted and humorous atmosphere &mdash; the jokes are terrible but I
    love them! I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is keen on
    exploring deep learning surrounded by an interesting and diverse group of
    people."

    "I couldn't recommend this workshop more to anyone wanting to get started
    with deep learning. It's fun, interactive and informative. Deep learning
    is a relatively difficult subject but Noon and Ruth make it easier to
    understand with lots of examples. I really appreciate their patience in
    explaining and helping people who have less technical background."

    "[...] It has been a great learning experience so far with Ruth and Noon
    who are fantastic in breaking down complex deep learning concepts into
    readily understandable form. They have provided specific direction on
    searching for relevant information regarding ML/DL.  Besides, the
    workshop is very engaging and participative with lots of interactions
    between fellow participants. In addition to learning, it has been a
    fantastic opportunity to network with diverse community of participants.
    We have together designed a neural network for image classification and
    coded it in TensorFlow python which I am very happy about. [...] I am
    much more confident and comfortable with Machine Learning/Deep Learning
    contents now than I was before. I am looking forward to build machine
    learning models that [are] applicable for genomic analysis.
