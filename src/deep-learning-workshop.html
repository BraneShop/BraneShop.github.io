  <h5>Breakdown of the days</h5>
  <div class="breakdown">
    <div class="day">
      <p> <b> Day 1 </b> - <em> Fundamentals: Deep Learning, 
          Learning Theory, Convolutions, Embeddings. </em>
      </p>
      <p> The first day provides a solid base of knowledge, by
          covering key concepts through group learning and exercises.
      </p>

      <p> Attendees will implement a reference model in TensorFlow,
          and learn the necessary components of all deep learning
          training pipelines.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="day">
      <p> <b> Day 2 </b> - <em> Group Projects. </em>
      </p>

      <p> The last day provides hands-on experience in deep learning model
          development, in TensorFlow.
      </p>

      <p> Participants will consolidate their knowledge by working in
          small groups on independent projects. Project options vary 
          across image processing, embeddings, and generative models.

      "I highly recommend this workshop to anyone who is looking for a solid
      introduction to Deep Learning including its applications and where it fits
      in the AI landscape. The mix of hands-on and presented material was very
      well balanced and blended.  The workshop atmosphere was both convivial and
      conducive to learning."

      "As the top "deep learningers" in the town, the organisers have profound
      knowledge and experience. They are also active in sharing their knowledge
      and getting more people interested. Their lecture notes are fascinating
      and can engage audiences of all levels. If you ever got "buzzed" by
      'deep learning', here's where you should go."

      "I found this a fun introduction to deep learning fundamentals, the
      TensorFlow toolkit, and how it can be applied to real-world situations.
      Sometimes you just need a bit of bootstrap to get your mind going with
      an emerging technology, and this course does just that."

      balanced exercise of theory and practical training useful for anyone
      trying to decipher the landscape of deep learning."

      "I appreciated there were many exercises to work hard on, and ask any
      question without judgment. Noon and Josh went to great lengths to explain
      things in different ways to ensure everyone was on the same page. I was
      glad to see ethics being added and hearing the team acknowledge the
      unknowns in the field."
