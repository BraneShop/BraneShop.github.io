  <h3>ðŸ”® $title$</h3>

  <p>Using <a href="">TensorFlow.js</a> 
  (see <a href="tags/tensorflowjs.html">here for our blog posts on the
  topic</a>) we can use the camera on your device to detect objects and draw
	boxes around them! In order to do this, we need to request to access your
	camera. 
  </p>

  <p>When it's working, you will see something like the below (depending on
  what it's pointing at!)
  </p>
  <center><img src="/images/object-dection-working.png" width="60%" /></center>

  <p>Where we have black boxes drawn around what it thinks it sees; with the
  name of the thing above it, and in brackets, (roughly) an estimate of "how
  confident" the network is that what it's it is seeing. Note that the network
  itself is not perfect, and it will get confused and certianly won't detect
  everything (for example, it misses the second cup in this photo, as well as
  the book). But it gives a feeling for the kinds of things that cna be done!
