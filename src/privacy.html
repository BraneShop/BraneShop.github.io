        <p> Ultimately, the Braneshop is interested in building AI literacy and

          surplus</a>" &mdash;
        behavioural data as a product in-and-of-itself &mdash; and make no effort,
        outside of standard analytics tools such as Google and Facebook, to
        determine, infer, or derive information that you have not explicitly
        provided.
        </p>

        <p> Our overall aim with any data collection is:
