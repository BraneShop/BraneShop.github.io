    <p> With the power of deep learning here's what a few of our friends had the following to say:
    </p>
    <div class="testmonials-list">
      <div class="testimonial">
        <img src="/images/fake_testimonials/Sanaf-Rahnke.jpeg" width="300" height="300" />
        <p> <span class="input">"I really enjoyed this workshop; Noon and Ruth
          know deep learning</span>
          adequately. I immediately felt cleverer when I began designing
          techniques, and lying down helped me overcome physical distance to
          this ground, which worried me getting better."  &mdash; Amy Hammer

      <div class="testimonial">
        <img src="/images/fake_testimonials/Gaoji-Lisauro.jpeg" width="300" height="300" />
        <p>
          <span class="input">"The best thing about the deep learning workshop is</span>
          that you get to build an own practice environment," said Gaoji Lisauro, the
          CEO and cofounder of Asgard CognosceBlue. "You can expand massively with
          additional deep learning projects without breaking the bank."

      <div class="testimonial">
        <img src="/images/fake_testimonials/Nicola-Gorra-Buliffour.jpeg" width="300" height="300" />
        <p> <span class="input">"The one aspect I got the most out of
          was</span> my discussions with the students," Gorra-Buliffour says.
          "It was really exciting to have a direct assessment that everybody
          understood and all were placed in safe, consensual energy centers."

      <div class="testimonial">
        <img src="/images/fake_testimonials/Tubir-Zaccarelli.jpeg" width="300" height="300" />
        <p>
          <span class="input">As leading AI experts, Noon and Ruth taught us</span>
          a lot about the world beyond computer systems. After leading us in creating
          world-transformating AI for engines, they are an invaluable resource
          that helps other AI researchers understand the complexities of the material
          world." &mdash; Tubir Zaccarelli, CEO, Bristol Robotics

    <h4>Explanation</h4>

    <p> This is a silly thing we put together using images from 
      <a href="http://thispersondoesnotexist.com/" rel="noopener">This Person
        Does Not Exist</a> (<a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan">StyleGAN</a>), text from 
      <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/"
        rel="noopener">GPT-2</a> (the 345M model), and names from <a
        href="https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow"
        rel="noopener">char-rnn</a> (trained on authors
      from <a href="https://arxiv.org/" rel="noopener">arXiv</a>).
      The input to GPT-2 is the <span class="input">text with the gray
        background</span>, the resulting text is the unedited output up until
      the first complete sentence.
