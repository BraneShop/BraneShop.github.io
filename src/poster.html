      "I highly recommend this workshop to anyone who is looking for a solid
      introduction to Deep Learning including its applications and where it fits
      in the AI landscape. The mix of hands-on and presented material was very
      well balanced and blended.  The workshop atmosphere was both convivial and
      conducive to learning."

      "As the top "deep learningers" in the town, the organisers have profound
      knowledge and experience. They are also active in sharing their knowledge
      and getting more people interested. Their lecture notes are fascinating
      and can engage audiences of all levels. If you ever got "buzzed" by
      'deep learning', here's where you should go."

    <div class="day">
      <p class="t"> <b> Day 1 </b> - <em> Fundamentals: Deep Learning, 
          Learning Theory, Convolutions, Embeddings. </em>
      </p>
      <p> The first day provides a solid base of knowledge, by
          covering key concepts through group learning and exercises.
      </p>

      <p> Attendees will implement a reference model in TensorFlow,
          and learn the necessary components of all deep learning
          training pipelines.
      </p>

    <div class="day">
      <p class="t"> <b> Day 2 </b> - <em> Hands-On TensorFlow: TensorBoard, Training, Evaluation. </em>
      </p>
      
      <p> On the second day we will work through the details of training
          models in TensorFlow in more detail. We will build a reference
          model, and learn how to train our model, check it's progress,
          and evaluate it's accuracy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="day">
      <p class="t"> <b> Day 3 </b> - <em> Group Projects. </em>
      </p>

      <p> The last day provides hands-on experience in deep learning model
          development, in TensorFlow.
      </p>

      <p> Participants will consolidate their knowledge by working in
          small groups on independent projects. Project options vary 
          across image processing, embeddings, and generative models.

      <h5>Questions you'll be able to answer after taking this workshop: </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>How does deep learning differ from machine learning
            and normal programming?
        </li>
        <li>How do you build deep learning models in TensorFlow?</li>
        <li> What are some common deep learning architectures, and
            how can I apply them?
        </li>
        <li> How do I build a good data set for training? How much
              data do I need?
        </li>
        <li> How do I process text with deep learning? What about images?
          What about both, jointly?!
