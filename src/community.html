  <h3>ðŸ¥˜ Community</h3>

  <p> We love community. We believe that the best way to make change is
  from the ground up; with the people most affected by any change to be
  strongly involved in it's implementation. This is what drives our
  interest in education: We want to empower communities to change themselves
  in ways they see fit.</p>

  <p> For the last few years, in conjunction with 
  <a href="http://silverpond.com.au" rel="noopener"
                                     title="Silverpond">Silverpond</a>, we've made an
  effort to grow the AI community in Melbourne.
  </p>

  <p> These communities are moderated, and members of all these communities
  are required to follow the <a
