  <h3>ðŸ¥˜ Community</h3>

  <p> We love community. We believe that the best way to make change is
  from the ground up; with the people most affected by any change to be
  strongly involved in it's implementation. This is what drives our
  interest in education: We want to empower communities to change themselves
  in ways they see fit.</p>

  <p> For the last few years, in conjunction with we've made an effort to grow
  the AI community in Melbourne.  </p>

  <p> These communities are moderated, and members of all these communities
  are required to follow the <a
  href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Django Code of Conduct</a>.

        <p> We started the <b>ML/AI Slack Channel</b> to facilitiate
        communication between members of the community in Melbourne. It's
        since gathered an international contingent, and we continue
        to support it's growth into a global, vibrant community.

        <p> We are the maintainers of the open science network SciRate. It
        acts as a way for the community to discover papers of interest, across
          fields, and comment and "scite" the papers that they like. SciRate
          acts as a "front" for the 
          <a href="https://arxiv.org" rel="noopener">arXiv</a>, and thus the
          papers are open-access and free for all. The arXiv is essentially
          the home of cutting-edge research in the <em>many</em> fields,
          including computer science, physics, and is an excellent way to stay
          up-to-date on the various fields of AI (and quantum machine learning!)
