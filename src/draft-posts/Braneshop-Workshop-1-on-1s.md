Hope you're all doing well.

I've been thinking a bit about how Braneshop can continue down the workshop
path, in some online capacity.

After chatting to my friend
[Eike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eike-zeller-1464b767/), who encouraged me
to come up with something that could be done especially well in this climate,
I came up with one idea, and I wanted to get some feedback, to see if
people would be interested in it.

#### Rough proposal

The basic idea is to move to video-chat based format, but where the material
itself isn't presented directly, but available for reading at your own pace,
and the video-chats are organised as 1-on-1's with individual students
so we can focus on individual experiences and give very personalised
instruction and feedback.

The second idea is, becaused under this format the workshop content doesn't
need to be presented in a group, _you can set the final project of your own
workshop_, or you can follow our suggestions.

Right now all our workshops have been focused on understanding
convolutional networks and autoencoders, but there's no reason we need to
limit to that. I'd be very keen to explore other aspects of deep learning, and
specialise, depending on where you, individually, want to go.


In dot points:

1. Initial chat to determine direction and goals; set rough outcomes,
1. Content available online, as it's ready, read at your own pace,
1. Exercises provided and expected to be completed,
1. **Exercise check-in points**, via 1-on-1 office-hours
1. General discussion also via 1-on-1's, handled via a healthy allocation of
   office hours per person per workshop.
1. Complete entire course over, roughly a six-week period

<!--
NOTE: Where should group projects fit in?

#### Feedback

I'm really interested in your thoughts.

- Would this format work for you?
- What else would you like to see, if anything?
