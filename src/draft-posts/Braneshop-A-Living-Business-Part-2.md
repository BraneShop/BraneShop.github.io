### Idea: The Living Business<a name="living-business"></a>

1. **Presence**

From mindfulness, we recognise that the present moment is valuable. It's where
we live and work. It's important to enjoy and value this moment.

For Braneshop this means acknowledging and being aware of the present work.
Enjoying the current workshop; the current group of people we're working with;
the current projects; the current activity.

We aim to have a "present"-mindset instead of a "growth"-mindset, as such,
when we think about the future we think about the ability to work on projects
we enjoy with people we enjoy spending time with. This is a shift from the
business status-quo of outlining a plan for growth in terms of the people
employeed or revenue projections.

We focus our efforts on doing business without compromising our value of the
present moment &mdash; no short-term compromises for long-term gain. Although
we recognise that our actions <i>now</i> impact where we are as a business in
the future, the important part is whatever path we take to get there, each
<i>step</i> is good; not just the final step.


2. **Local focus over "Big Goals"**

A common theme of all the books was that of "local focus". In most of the
mindfulness books, the theme is "start with yourself" or "[start where you
are](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/815715.Start_Where_You_Are)". From
[The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)
we learned that the best way to make change is in local chunks.

I think of this as making change "upwards", locally, instead of
prescriptively, "from the top", downwards.

This means that our aim is on helping those around us, <i>and</i>, crucially,
our environment.

Further, we want Braneshop to "fit well" into its local community. That
means, the things we do should be well matched to the needs of the people (and
businesses) who are nearby. This is perhaps obvious, but it means that the
focus of the business is, mostly, _driven by what's around it_.

This also is a nice rule of thumb for how the business should invest in
activities. I've discussed this idea previously on [my personal
blog](https://silky.github.io/posts/2018-11-09-quick-note-on-budgeting.html).
In short, it means that smaller investments in many different ideas, as
compared to significant investments in just one or two ideas.


3. **Adaption over "Growth"**

A standard idea in business is that it should "grow". But an important theme
in the mindfulness community, and in The Timeless Way of Building is that of
<i>adaption</i> to the existing environment. In fact, this is also a theme in
Horizon.

I think it's a very important and relevant idea for how I see Braneshop
changing over the years.  Concretely, this means that our aim is <i>not</i>
constant growth, or growth at all costs, but incremental adaption based on
"diagnosis" (see next item).


4. **"Diagnosis" over Plans**

Following on from adaption, another very related theme is that of
_incremental_ change, instead of change directed by a fully-formed plan.

The "plan", then is, if you will, "The plan of no plan". The idea here is to
look at the aspects of the business, and make a judgement as to how well they
are functioning, and which areas need attention.

The axes on which you evaluate the business, are, extrapolating from The
Timeless Way of Building, what they call "patterns". In the
[Appendix](#appendix) of this article I list a few of the patterns I'm
thinking about for Braneshop.

In this way you can adapt to changing environments. Furthermore, it's a useful
tool for addressing problems and areas that need focus.


5. **"Stakeholders" over Shareholders**

This is straight out of The Value of Everything, and is a growing movement
world-wide.

The point is, we're not only interested in direct profit. We're interested in
supporting the environment and people that help us to live. Our actions have
impacts on everyone around us, and thus we need to be observant of such
interactions, and use that information to change what we do. Again this feeds
into the "Diagnosis" idea; we need continuous engagement from the community,
and we need to listen to it and adapt based on it.

Some examples of this are the idea of pushing more ethics and empathy into AI,
thinking about, and offsetting, the environmental impact of the
computation required for machine learning, and generally engaging with
those communities whom our work impacts.


### Conclusion

This is a work in progress. I want to get feedback from people as to how this
idea sits with them. That includes you! I'd love to know if you have any
thoughts on this idea.  I'm interested to hear them. You can reach
out to me any time: [noon@braneshop.com.au](mailto:noon@braneshop.com.a).

I also want to use this as a framework for future discussions with people who
are engaging with the Braneshop business, be it through workshops, mentors, or
employees.


#### Appendix <a name="appendix"></a>

One of the things Christopher Alexander is most well-known for is [A Pattern
Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language). This
turns out to be a very important concept in his joint work [The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)
where the idea of diagnosis is developed.

The idea is that these patterns form the basis for how we think about whatever
it is we're building. They're the essential elements. Importantly, they are
measurable, and we can check our progress against them using the "diagnosis"
approach.

There's more work to be done here, but below is an initial list that is proving
helpful for me in thinking about various aspects of Braneshop.
