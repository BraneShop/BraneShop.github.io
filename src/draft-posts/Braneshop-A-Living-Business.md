For a while now I've been thinking about how I'd like to describe the business
goals of Braneshop. I've also been having some discussions with different
people about how the Braneshop might align with their businesses, and
naturally they are interested in where Braneshop is "heading".

The question is this: What kind of business is Braneshop? How do I see it
changing over the years? What are the aims? 

After thinking about it for a while, I think it's nicely captured by the idea
of what I'm going to call "A Living Business". 

In the following blog post, I'll talk about what this means, and where the
inspiration for it came from. It might get a bit weird. But if you're
interested in what the Braneshop is about as an organisation, then read on!

In order to make sense of the idea, I want to first start by introducing the
ideas that inspired me. If you want to skip straight to the details, [you may

#### First Inspiration: Christopher Alexander

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/nature-of-order.jpg" width="300px" /></center>

One of my favourite discoveries of recent years has been the work of
[Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander)
and colleagues.

Introduced to me by my good friend Reuben, I started with [The Timeless Way of
Building](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106728.The_Timeless_Way_of_Building).
Some of my new favourites are [The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)
and, as we shall see, [The Nature of
Order](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3131171-the-nature-of-order).

One of the big focus points for this work is:  What makes something feel
"alive"? We know it when we walk into a space and it just makes us _feel_
good. How can we quantify that idea? How can we construct it? He goes into
significant detail in the Nature of Order series.

The exploration is within the field of architecture and urban planning, and
some of the elements brought up are:

- How well does this building interact with its environment?
- How was it constructed?
    - Pre-planned? Or adapted?
- How were problems discovered and addressed?
- Who was involved in the construction?
- How do things change over time? Should a building ever be "finished"?
- Where should attention be focused when it comes time to make changes?

In the context of the Braneshop, we can consider:

- How well does the Braneshop integrate into the local business landscape?
- What kind of planning should be involved in the business, and who should be
involved?
- Should there be an end-point?
- How do we decide which parts of the business are going well, and which parts
are going badly?
- What should be our focus and over what time period?


#### Inspiration #2: Mindfulness

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/buddhism.png" width="300px" /></center>

Another discovery of recent years has been the "scientific" adoption of
certain mindfulness ideas, and in general Buddhist ideas.

Perhaps one of the
best examples of this is a book I was recommended by my friend Julia &mdash;
[Why Buddhism Is
True](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32895535-why-buddhism-is-true)
(a nice/funny [talk by the Author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJZTrVlSBTY)). 

The aim of this book is to show how (scientific) ideas in modern psychology
are related to (at first seemingly-mystical) ideas in Buddhism.  Although the
title is probably provocative, the book itself is very reasonable and well
worth a glance.

We'll very roughly summarise the ideas of mindfulness as:

- Focus on "awareness",
- Ability and intention to focus on "the present",
- Empathy for ourselves and others,
- Desire to not cause harm and suffering to ourselves and others.

As it relates to Braneshop, we will consider:

- How does "the present" relate to business planning?
- Are we aware of how we're impacting the community?
- What can we do to build empathy?


#### Final Inspiration: The Value of Everything

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/mariana.png" width="300px" /></center>

The final book that has been sitting in my head when thinking of these ideas
is the work of [Mariana
Mazzucato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Mazzucato), and in particular
her book [The Value of
Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502362-the-value-of-everything).

The work is a really inspiring discussion of economics, and in particular
&mdash; what is valuable work? How should countries estimate how well they
are doing? To what degree should the government get involved in "everyday"
business?

One idea she discusses is the idea of "Shareholders" (people who hold a
percentage of your company) versus "Stakeholders" (people whom your
company impacts, financially or otherwise).

She raises the observation that maximising "shareholder" value is not the only
thing a business needs can do. In particular, a business exists within an
ecosystem; within the environment, and impacts people and it's ecosystem.

There are many people working on and thinking about this idea now, from
[BCorps](https://bcorporation.com.au/), community organisations, social
enterprises, and others.

For the Braneshop, the central questions are:

- How do we measure and think about our impact?
- Should we be going for maximimum profit, or something else?
- What are we trying to improve?


#### Bonus Inspiration: Barry Lopez, Shoshanna Zuboff

Two other books that I'm sure have influenced my thoughts on this matter are
[Horizon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15259073-horizon) by Barry
Lopez, and [The Age of Surveillance
Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism)
by Shoshana Zuboff.

Horizon is a very poetic book, focused on thinking about Indigenous cultures,
the envrionment, and lost knowledge. It's a nice reminder of the changes
occuring on the planet, and how we can get our minds around these ideas.

Surveillance Capitalism is an incredibly well-researched and significant work
on the activities of companies like Google and Facebook, and discusses how our
data, and AI, is being used to influence behaviour. It's a huge wake-up call
that individual decisions of everyone within technical teams can have
significant impact; and that as an industry, the AI community needs to be
aware of the power they are putting in the hands of very few.


### So ...

All these ideas influence the Braneshop business.

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/braneshop-inspo.png" width="100%" /></center>

How then do we describe and understand what we're about? What is the goal of
Braneshop? Do we want to grow big? Stay small? 

Ultimately, how will these ideas help us make decisions?


### Idea: The Living Business<a name="living-business"></a>

The framework I have in mind is what I'm calling "A Living Business" (where
the idea of "life" comes from The Timeless Way of Building <i>and</i> the
enjoyment of life from mindfulness).

Here's what it means:

1. **Presence**

One of the essential ideas in mindfulness is the recognition that the present
moment is everything. That maybe it's not the best idea to always be striving
for something else, but enjoy what we have at this exact moment.

As such, the idea is to acknowledge the present work. Enjoy the current
workshop; the current group of people we're working with, the current
projects; the current activity.

Do we want to grow to 5 people in 1 year? 200 people? It's irrelevant. In 10
years, and right now, we want to be working on projects we enjoy, with people
we enjoy spending time with.

Another way to think about this aspect is by way of no-compromising on values.
I.e. if work comes up that will support Braneshop, but is not "socially good",
or otherwise disagrees with our values, then we don't take the work. This
changes who we go after as clients, and who we seek to support and work
with.


2. **Local focus over "Big Goals"**

A common theme of all the books was that of "local focus". In most of the
mindfulness books, the theme is "start with yourself" or "[start where you
are](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/815715.Start_Where_You_Are)". From
[The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)
we learned that the best way to make change is in local chunks.

I think of this as making change "upwards", locally, instead of
prescriptively, "from the top", downwards.

This means that our aim is on helping those around us, <i>and</i>, crucially,
our environment.

Further, we want Braneshop to "fit well" into its local community. That
means, the things we do should be well matched to the needs of the people (and
businesses) who are nearby. This is perhaps obvious, but it means that the
focus of the business is, mostly, _driven by what's around it_.

This also is a nice rule of thumb for how the business should invest in
activities. I've discussed this idea previously on [my personal
blog](https://silky.github.io/posts/2018-11-09-quick-note-on-budgeting.html).
In short, it means that smaller investments in many different ideas, as
compared to significant investments in just one or two ideas.


3. **Adaption over "Growth"**

A standard idea in business is that it should "grow". But an important theme
in the mindfulness community, and in The Timeless Way of Building is that of
<i>adaption</i> to the existing environment. In fact, this is also a theme in
Horizon.

I think it's a very important and relevant idea for how I see Braneshop
changing over the years.  Concretely, this means that our aim is <i>not</i>
constant growth, or growth at all costs, but incremental adaption based on
"diagnosis" (see next item).


4. **"Diagnosis" over Plans**

Following on from adaption, another very related theme is that of
_incremental_ change, instead of change directed by a fully-formed plan.

The "plan", then is, if you will, "The plan of no plan". The idea here is to
look at the aspects of the business, and make a judgement as to how well they
are functioning, and which areas need attention.

The axes on which you evaluate the business, are, extrapolating from The
Timeless Way of Building, what they call "patterns". In the
[Appendix](#appendix) of this article I list a few of the patterns I'm
thinking about for Braneshop.

In this way you can adapt to changing environments. Furthermore, it's a useful
tool for addressing problems and areas that need focus.


5. **"Stakeholders" over Shareholders**

This is straight out of The Value of Everything, and is a growing movement
world-wide.

The point is, we're not only interested in direct profit. We're interested in
supporting the environment and people that help us to live. Our actions have
impacts on everyone around us, and thus we need to be observant of such
interactions, and use that information to change what we do. Again this feeds
into the "Diagnosis" idea; we need continuous engagement from the community,
and we need to listen to it and adapt based on it.

Some examples of this are the idea of pushing more ethics and empathy into AI,
thinking about, and offsetting, the environmental impact of the
computation required for machine learning, and generally engaging with
those communities whom our work impacts.


### Conclusion

This is a work in progress. I want to get feedback from people as to how this
idea sits with them. That includes you! I'd love to know if you have any
thoughts on this idea.  I'm interested to hear them. You can reach
out to me any time: [noon@braneshop.com.au](mailto:noon@braneshop.com.a).

I also want to use this as a framework for future discussions with people who
are engaging with the Braneshop business, be it through workshops, mentors, or
employees.


#### Appendix <a name="appendix"></a>

One of the things Christopher Alexander is most well-known for is [A Pattern
Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language). This
turns out to be a very important concept in his joint work [The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)
where the idea of diagnosis is developed.

The idea is that these patterns form the basis for how we think about whatever
it is we're building. They're the essential elements. Importantly, they are
measurable, and we can check our progress against them using the "diagnosis"
approach.

There's more work to be done here, but below is an initial list that is proving
helpful for me in thinking about various aspects of Braneshop.
