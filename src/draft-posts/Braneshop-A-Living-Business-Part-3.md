### Braneshop Pattern Language

One of the things Christopher Alexander is most well-known for is [A Pattern
Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language). This
turns out to be a very important concept in his joint work [The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)
where the idea of diagnosis is developed.

The idea is that these patterns form the basis for how we think about whatever
it is we're building. They're the essential elements. Importantly, they are
measurable, and we can check our progress against them using the "diagnosis"
approach.

There's more work to be done here, but below is an initial list that is proving
helpful for me in thinking about various aspects of Braneshop.
