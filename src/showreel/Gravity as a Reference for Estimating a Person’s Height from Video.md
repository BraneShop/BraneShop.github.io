I love this one for the awesome idea they've had. They want to solve a
reasonable problem - how tall is the person in this photo (here, actually, a
video). They're observation is that if they ask the person to _jump_, then
they can use information about gravity as supporting evidence to estimate the
height! It's such a neat idea.
