This is mostly a technical result, but it's really neat for the art
applications. One of the problems with a lot of generative networks
is that they lack "diversity". This means that most of the time, the
kinds of pictures they generate are mostly the same. This work address
this problem, and even more impressively, it addresses it <i>without</i>
the need to train the model again!

Very cool.
