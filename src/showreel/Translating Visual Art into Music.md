This one is weird and I love it. The idea is to translate a painting, let's
say, into music, so that vision-impaired people can learn to enjoy paintings.
This one is fascinating in that it tries to ensure that something like the
original image can be reconstructed from the stream of music. They phrase
art, then, as an information exchange. Crazy!
