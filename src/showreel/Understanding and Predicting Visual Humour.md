preview: Can a computer make un-funny things funny? Turns out&#58; Yes.

Easily Noon's favourite paper of 2015. In life we face many problems. One of them
is, given some non-funny situation, how can we make it funny? Naively one
might think computers can't begin to attemp to solve this problem. One would
be wrong. Consider the top row of this image. Two people having dinner. Very
unfunny. Two dogs having dinner at a dinner table? Hilarious. Likewise, cats
in a park? Unfunny. A racoon riding a scooter in the same park? Brilliant.

This network was trained on data generated by humans who took specific scenes
and adjusted them to make them funny.

We're not totally sure where we'll see more applications of this work, but we
love it.
