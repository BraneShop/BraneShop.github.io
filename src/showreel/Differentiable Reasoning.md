preview: Using logic to provide context for classification.

I really like the ideas of this one. There's a bit of work going around this
idea: contextual knowledge should help us. Here, the formalise this idea that
we can do better at classification if we know other things about what we're
trying to classify. In the photo the example is that we can do better a
deciding if something is a cushion if we know that it's at the very least part
of a chair.
