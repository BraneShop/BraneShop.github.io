One of the most exciting areas of AI is the generative/creative opportunities.
And in this area, something people are always fascinated by is the exploring
the "space" of images; i.e here are all the photos of people, but what does a
person who is "halfway between these two people" look like? This paper works
on that problem, and produces some very cool looking people such as Ryan
Obama, Oprah Johansson and Hugh de Niro. Notably, in this paper it seems like
it doesn't work so well for abstract/non-person style photos; but that's
probably due to the data, and not a general problem.
