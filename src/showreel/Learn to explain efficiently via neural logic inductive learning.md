Along the lines of explainability, this is a fascinating and important step.
Consider: How do you know that something is a car? What makes a person a
person? This paper attempts to address this problem by a kind of
"constructivist" approach. I.e. a car is a car because it has wheels.

I think this kind of logical reasoning will be increasingly important as
models make richer decisions, and as we seek to get solid explanations from
our models.
