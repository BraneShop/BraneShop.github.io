This is a moderately quirky one. The idea is that we take some
high-dimensional information (say, 3D) and then project it down to 2D. The
question is, how well can we reconstruct the original input? Turns out, pretty
well. This idea can be useful when thinking about how to compress
high-dimensional data.
