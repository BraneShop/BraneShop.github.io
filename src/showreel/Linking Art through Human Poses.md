This one is cool for the kind of neat technique it demonstrates. They use a
pose network (something that just looks at an image of a person, say, and
estimates what their skeleton looks like; i.e. it tries to guess some
straight lines that connect their arms and legs and such) to connect different
artworks. It's a neat application of what is becoming a standard technique.
