A simple dream realised. We take an audoclip, and a still image, and animate
the image as if it's speaking the audio. Check out [the video](https://youtu.be/OU6Ctzhpc6s).

Adobe is investing heavily in this kind of connection between audio and
images; they also did some early work on "audio inpainting".  Expect some cool
products from them in the future.
