More and more we're seeing deep learning tackle rich reconstruction problems
from simple inputs. This is a classic of the genre. As humans, we can easily
imagine the 3D structure of the person in the photo; and it turns out now deep
learning can do the same, via the techniques in this paper. It's very
impressive work, and is applicable for those people wishing to capture this
information without a complicated set up of a 3D body scanner. As usual, the
typical applications will be in retail, but maybe also augmented-reality and
other such fun things. As is the case with all these body-pose-related papers,
they use an underlying pose network and build on top of it's outputs. This is
also a central and important topic in modern AI: building up rich and strong
capabilities by combining different techniques.
