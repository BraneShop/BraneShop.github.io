preview: Generating synthetic datasets helps us solve real problems.
---

This is an old idea, and just one example among many. There's nothing
inherently outstanding in this paper, but we just wanted to note the very
useful technique of using "fake" (synthetic) data to help solve real-world
problems. This is a very useful technique, especially in light of the
remarkable abilities of [transfer
learning](/posts/2018-12-17-How-Much-Data-For-Retraining.html) to help us adapt
to new data.
