This is a quirky one, but it's kind of "flag-planting" in the ML/Security
world. For years, security researchers have spent time finding what they call
"side-channel" attacks. An example is, say, listening to the soup that someone
makes when typing, and from that sound, working out _what they are typing_.
It's called "side-channel" because it's not, say, capturing the keystrokes via
the computer, it's via an additional "channel".

The main point of this paper is that they're applying standard ML techniques,
in particular in regards to voltage, and are able to make an estimate of which
applications are running on a given piece of hardware. This might not sound
super useful as it is, but, as always in the security world, there's much more
juice to be squeezed here.

This will definitely be a space to watch in the security space - bringing in
AI techniques to enhance our offensive security capabilities!
