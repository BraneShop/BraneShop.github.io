This is a landmark paper for a few reasons. First of all, it's co-authored by
a movie star; secondly it's an application of the famous "style transfer"
algorithm to a short film, and importantly that put a significant amount of
work into making sure that the sylistic _quality_ of the style transfer
is high; which you don't typically see. It's a really interesting
collaboration between the researchers and the film industry. I'm sure we'll
see a lot more like this over the years!
