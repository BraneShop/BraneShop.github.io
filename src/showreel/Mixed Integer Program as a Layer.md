preview: Building MIP constraints into the optimisation of neural networks.
---

MIPs are close to my heart; and I really enjoy papers that combine many
techniques together. This one is interesting because, again, it's this idea of
combining constraints into neural networks, and in particular bringing this
information into the optimization of the overall network.

I'm not sure this idea has reached peak popularity yet, and it's great to see
more things being squeezed into the general capability of these deep networks.
