preview: Tool to help us understanding our embeddings.

As we cover in the [6 week workshop](/6-week-workshop-on-deep-learning.html),
embeddings are the essence of deep learning. So any method to compare and
understand them is going to be a big hit here.

As embeddings become more ... embedded in all aspects of our AI piplines,
tools like this will become increasingly important.

Furthermore, the idea of learning how to <i>explore</i> embedding spaces is
also very valuable, and I think this is a useful step in that direction.
