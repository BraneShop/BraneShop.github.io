Work from the famous [Fei Fei Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li),
this is a very neat idea. There's been some famous networks ("StackGAN") that
are able to generate pictures from text. But, they fail when you want to
generate a complicated and unfamiliar scene. Humans, of course, can
"dis-entangle" different concepts when thinking of complicated scenes, such as
"a cat waiting to catch the train". Even if we haven't seen this exact thing
before, we can easily imagine it, because we know how the things look,
independently. The contribution in this work is the same idea, for neural
networks, and they achieve awesome results! We can definitely expect
significant improvements in this area, over the coming years.
