This one is neat because, at least to me, I didn't even realise this could be
a problem. But, it turns out that if you're in the space business, you might
have occasion to be interested in which way your satellite is facing,
<i>especially</i> if it's not responding to your commands any further.

In this work, they introduce a dataset, and competition metrics, and some
baselines. Interesting problem!
