preview: Improving inpainting by thinking about structure
---

Inpainting is a classic task in computer vision: Given some empty area of an
otherwise complete image, can you figure out what should be there? This work
is interesting because they realise that "structure" is important when
thinking about solving this problem. In other words, you can say things like
"This part, and this part should be the same". It turns out that if they build
a network with this consideration baked in, then they can do really well at
this problem!
