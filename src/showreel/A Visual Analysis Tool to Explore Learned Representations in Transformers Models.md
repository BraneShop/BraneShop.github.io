This is a nice exploration in the space of UX of AI, and the ability to
understand what drives particular decisions and outcomes in a model. These
days, big text models (a "Transformer" is a certain kind of text model) can be
quite hard to understand.

The idea in this paper is to present a UI that can help with this! Nice
development. We can expect to see much more of this kind of thing over the
years.
