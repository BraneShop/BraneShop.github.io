I have a soft-spot for AI-generated architecture; and this one is interesting
because it gives the user some high-level control on what the generation does.
I.e. you can control the number of rooms, how they connect, and roughly the
layout.

This kind of thing, built well into modern CAD tools, would be really cool!
