One annoying technical issue that occurs in quantum machine learning is that,
_maybe_ it's possible to run a quantum algorithm that performs better than
a classical one, but you _lose_ all the speedup when you simply try and _read_
the answer out! So frustrating.

This paper addresses this problem.
