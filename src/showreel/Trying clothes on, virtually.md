This is a great example of attempting to apply AI in the real world. The
problem here is the typical online-shopping problem: Here's a thing that maybe
I want to buy; but how would it look on me? This paper attempts to solve that
problem by using pose information. It does a pretty good job for photos that
are "simple" (i.e. model on a white wall), and does a reasonable, but not
great, job on what is referred to as photos "in the wild" &mdash; just photos
from everyday life; inside or outside. Over the years we can expect to see
this kind of technology hit on-line retailers.
