This is an interesting one. WiFi is everywhere; and probably a reasonable
person wouldn't assume they could be tracked (down to estimates of where they
are walking, and the overall pose of their body) if there isn't a camera
around. But it turns out that this data actually _can_ be gathered in (an
ideal) WiFi set up. That is, the pose of people was determined _without_ a
camera; using _only_ WiFi signals. No doubt this field - sensing human
activity through non-camera based sensors - will continue to grow.
