Satellite imagery is a hot topic. There's been many stories of people using
such imagery to gain competitive advantage in many ways; from estimating the
number of sales at department stores, to prediction crop yield.

This paper in particular is very neat because they discuss a network that
allows them to compute fine-grained information &mdash; colour, position, and
angle of cars &mdash; in very large satellite photos.

This is really an impressive result.
