There's a lot of this kind of work going around at the moment. Building on a
large body of "adversarial" attacks; the researchers demonstrate that it's
possible to design an image, that can be printed on a t-shirt, that fools
person detectors.

A significant aspect of this work was to do with how the shirt moves as the
body moves; i.e. the shirt should work in "real-time" (and it does!)
