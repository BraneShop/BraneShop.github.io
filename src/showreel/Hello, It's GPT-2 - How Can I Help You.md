This is an interesting one. They use the now-famous [GPT-2
network](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) to help them understand queries from
users; they then build a sense of "belief" about what the user wants (in the
image you can see the system learning they want a "hotel" that it
"expensive" in the "center of town". Then, from that belief, they generate
a text response. This is our usual kind of favourite thing: the combination of
many techniques to produce a nice result.
