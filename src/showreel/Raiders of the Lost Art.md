preview: Using deep learning to recover lost art!

This is a super neat, practical application that I love. The authors address a
neat problem: suppose some canvas has some art has been painted over. Can we
recover that painting? Of course, given that some information is lost, we can
only go so far, but they neatly use Style Transfer to re-paint the lost
painting in the style of the supposed artist. Really cool!
