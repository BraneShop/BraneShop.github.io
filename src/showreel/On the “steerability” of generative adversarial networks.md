This is a cool paper. We've seen lots of generative work from "Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs)". In this work, they explore how "controllable"
such networks are. I.e., can we generate a picture of a dog, and _then_ zoom
in on it's face? Can we generate a building and change it from night to day?
They perform some investigations in this area, and show that there is lots to
be done, but solving these kinds of problems will become very important as
we see these generative networks used more widely.
