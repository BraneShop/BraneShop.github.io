preview: Using a combination of deep-learning techniques to figure out what people are doing!

A pretty standard, but useful, technique that uses a kind of multi-stage
network to: 1) compute the pose, 2) then from the a series of these poses,
ver time, work out what "action" people are performing. Specifically here they
focus on people going past train ticket machines in various ways, but the
application is general.
