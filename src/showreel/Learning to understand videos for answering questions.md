Videos are becoming increasingly prolific on the internet. Naturally, then, it
makes sense that researchers are spending time trying to understand them. One
particular area of research is so-called "Visual queastion-answering". The
point is to train a network to be able to watch a video, then answer questions
(via text) about what happened in the video. Some examples are provided in the
image above.

This work introduces a nice idea to this area, one that we're seeing
frequently on the showreel, namely: building up a rich representation first,
and then using that representation to further refine answers. This should be a
bit similar, conceptually, to the "Scene Graph" work, for example.

It's also neat that the researchers are from
