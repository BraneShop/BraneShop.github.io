Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are hugely popular for generating fake
images. But a key topic is fine-grained editing and adjusting. I.e. you can
generate a random person, but can you generate a random _smiling_ person? To
what degree can we edit these visual features of people?

This paper presents a mechanism by using reference images and regions and
transferring them onto the generated images. Neat! And useful.
