Simliar to the "MIPs as a Layer" paper, this one is again about enforcing
constraints into neural networks, but here the view is that we want to do this
so that it respects the physical constraints of physical systems. As we
attempt to solve more Physics problems with deep learning, we'll see much more
of this. I think it's exciting!
