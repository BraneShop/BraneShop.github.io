This is an [interesting tool](https://github.com/princetonvisualai/vibe-tool)
that helps formalise how to think about bias in your datasets. It allows you
to gain formalised insights (i.e. "you don't have enough data from this
country") and then generate concrete actions. It's early days, but tools
like this will be very useful as the field matures.
