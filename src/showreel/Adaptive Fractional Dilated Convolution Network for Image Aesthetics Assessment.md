preview: Which makes an image beautiful?
---

I like this idea because it reminds me of Christopher Alexander's ideas of the
objective beauty of photos and the idea of considering which photo has more
"life".

It's also useful for judging the quality of generative images; which is the
most asthetic?

Interesting work.
