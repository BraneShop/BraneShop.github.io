Improving the situation around AI Ethics is strongly on our agenda at the
Braneshop. This paper highlights an interesting situation: suppose you have
people who want to provide feedback to some decision making process; what
should the interface they use look like? 

Here they explore a potential design that allows people to see the _impact_ of
their actions in a variety of ways.

This won't be the last word on the matter, but it's a nice contribution to the
field, and hopefully pushes people to think very hard about this problem.

This is one bit of work in a growing field we refer to as "The UX of AI".
This will definitely be a huge area over the coming years.
