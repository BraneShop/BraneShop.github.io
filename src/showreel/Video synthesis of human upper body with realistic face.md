We're seeing a lot of work like this with the "#DeepFake" meme. The point here
is that they're completely generating (somewhat) arbitrary poses of people
sitting at desks, talking. I.e. with generate hand-movements, body movements,
head movements, and mouth movements. This work is just yet another that makes
a significant contribution to this meme. Expect these fake videos to become
better and better, and harder to detect.
