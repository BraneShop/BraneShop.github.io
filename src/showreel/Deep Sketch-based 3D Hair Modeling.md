preview: Generating 3D hair models from sketches!

This is one my long-time dreams. I've often wanted something to help me
generate different haircuts. What this work introduces, is the ability to draw
a rough sketch of the hair, and have the model produce a full, rich, 3D model
of the hair! Amazing work.
