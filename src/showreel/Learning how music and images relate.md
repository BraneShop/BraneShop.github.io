preview: We can learn how to think about music and images in the same "space", and thus work out when they are related.

This result is nice because it's using a concept that we think is so
important, we've made it a central part of our [technical
workshop](/6-week-workshop-on-deep-learning.html): the autoencoder.

In this work they map images and music into the same "space" (i.e. points on
the graph in the picture), and in-so-doing, they can learn when images and
music are related! Nice, simple, and useful!
