Again, a neat idea applied well. In this paper they suppose that, in fact, we
don't need detailed road networks to do reasonably well at estimating travel
time. We just need to get a vague feeling for the kinds of areas we'll be
travelling though (i.e. highway, commercial, residential, country, park,
urban, etc). They make these ideas precise and get some great results!
