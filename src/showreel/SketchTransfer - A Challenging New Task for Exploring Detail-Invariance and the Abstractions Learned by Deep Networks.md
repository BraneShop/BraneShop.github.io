This isn't a network itself; it's a dataset and a proposed task. The idea of
this dataset is that there is definitely a similarity between _sketches_ of
real objects, and photos of those objects; but, neural networks aren't great
at knowing this abstraction, yet. I.e. If I have an object-classifier, it
can't very well classify sketches. We'll see how people progress towards this
problem via this dataset!
