preview: Conceptually simple; amazing results. Build a 3D model of a face from a single image!

Ignoring the specific contributions, this is a conceptually simple paper; but
the results look amazing. The idea is: can we find a 3D model from a single
image? And how much detail can it capture?

Turns out, heaps of detail! They introduce some nice techniques for modelling
the facial features and such, but the main thing I like are the results.
