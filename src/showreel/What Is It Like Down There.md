This is already a classic of the generative genre. They take a satellite
photo, and then use GANs to work out what that particular region woud look
like if viewed from the ground.

It's amusing to me because it's moderately well-posed; i.e. there is
definitely the data present to make _some_ kind of guess, but getting to the
ground truth is kind of "obviously" impossible.

Even under such contraints, they do pretty well! And, as we most of this
generative work, this is something that will only get better.
