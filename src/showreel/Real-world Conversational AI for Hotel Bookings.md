We don't feature a lot of chatbots here, but I thought this one was
interesting because of how real-world focused it is.  If you check the paper
you'll see that they have an explicit consideration for when a
human should take over a convseration. Furthermore, this is a real
system deployed in the real world. Furthermore, they should how
they've utilised some cutting-edge models (BERT). It's good to see
this kind of real-world design.
