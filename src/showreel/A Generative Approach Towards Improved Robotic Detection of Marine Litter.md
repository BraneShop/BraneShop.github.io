This is another neat example of real-world AI. The point here is that working
out what is trash or is otherwise a cool-looking sea animal or coral, is
surprisingly hard. 

One of the issues, as in many real-world situations, a lack of data.

But, by using some standard deep-learning approaches, namely by
<i>generating</i> the images they need, they are able to get enough data to
train a good model!
