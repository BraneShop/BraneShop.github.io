preview: Using adversarial networks to trick financial auditors!
---

This is a neat one because it's taking a cute idea and adapting it to a
(very exciting!) business process. Namely, the financial auditing of a
business.

The point here is that, by being able to <i>generate</i> accounting records,
we might be able to mislead auditors; or at least some computer-based
auditing assessments. The idea would be, by using this kind of approach,
one could construct misleading journal entries.

I think it's really interesting to see this kind of adversarial work move out
of the domain of images and into the finance world! I'm sure we'll see more of
these kind of general adversarial networks over coming years!
