preview: Turns out it's possible to learn improved compression techniques for a given collection of images.

A natural thought would be that if we know a lot about the thing we're trying
to compress, we can do a better job. Standard compression algorithms are
general-purpose, and as such, there is probably room to improve. This is the
observation and work in this paper: They _learn_ a compression function for a
specific set of data, and they do really well! Probably not suitable for most
of us, but you can be sure the big data storage providers will be working on
these kinds of techniques into the future.

If we wanted to be trendy we could summarise this as "big data makes small
data".
