preview: Technical result that let's networks generalise more conservatively from examples.

This one is a bit technical, but the main idea here is that they are able to
"moderate" how reinforcement-learning networks will extrapolate, when they are
learning by example. An analogy would be that, when you watch someone take a
sip from a cup, you assume "brilliant, I can drink from any thing that I am
holding", and then you try and drink from a pen, or a book, or such. Here,
they introduce the idea that perhaps you should act a bit conservatively in
areas where you are unsure, such as holding new things.
