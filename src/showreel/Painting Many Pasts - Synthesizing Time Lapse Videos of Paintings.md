preview: Working out how a painting should be painted!

This is a cute one. The idea is simply to see if it's' possible to show the
"painting progression" of a finished painting. I.e. what might be
(photographs) of the steps of making this painting?

I think this is a really neat idea; would love to see some artists try and
replicate the steps, to confirm that they (somewhat) match reality!
