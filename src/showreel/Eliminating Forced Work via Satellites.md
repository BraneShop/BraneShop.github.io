This is an amazing application. The researchers train a fairly standard
detection network, "resnet", and train it to detect certain objects in
satellite imagery. Here, though, what they are detecting are "brick kilns";
places where there may be forced labour. By helping identify these locations,
they can then be referred to the authorities!

This is a beautiful application of deep learning, and the authors note that
they are also addressing one of the [UNs sustainable development
goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/)!
