This is an idea that I worked on a long time ago. The idea is simple: Can we
generate a dancing animation in response to music? Indeed, it's possible.

Here, the contribution is around aligning movements to beats, and other bits
of necessary busywork to decouple different musical elements so they can be
used by the network.

You can see some generated videos over on their
