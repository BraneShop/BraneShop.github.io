preview: Can we figure out what the audio should be if we have the video?

This is an interesting one. The idea is, we've lost some audio information in
our video. We still have the video imagery, but a chunk of audio is gone. Can
we use the remaining audio _and_ the video, to reconstruct the missing part?
The answer is yes. Neat!
