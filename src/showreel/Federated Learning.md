preview: How we can train across many distributed devices in a privacy-preserving way.
---

This one is interesting from a real-world/privacy angle. We know that we're
going to see more and more deep learning on phones. And we're going to have
our phones start to adapt to us. But we'd also like to know how to leverage
data from _other_ peoples activities, but in a private way. How can we train
things in this regime? How should distributed training even work? This paper
presents some current research, challenges, and ideas for the future.
