This one is a neat and interesting idea. The point is, consider a paragraph of
text. What image should accompany that text? It turns out, you can solve this
problem by learning what's in images, and what the text is talking about. I
think this is something we'll probably see more of over the years; aligned
content generation, i.e. "this goes with that".
