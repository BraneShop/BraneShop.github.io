This is a fun one. First, try and find "something" in the photo (it's
normal-sized; and you'll know it when you see it).

...

Did you find anything?

Now, try searching for: <span class="hidden">a cat</span> (highlight this
section of text to see it). Can you find it now that I've told you what to
look for? Even if you can't, it turns out that neural networks can. I think
this is a really neat idea - priming a network to help it know what it's
trying to do.
