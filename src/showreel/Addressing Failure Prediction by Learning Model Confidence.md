preview: How can we think about and understand "confidence" in ML systems?
---

This is topic close to my heart. I'm very interested in thinking about how we
interpret the predictions of ML models, and if a model can even give any kind
of meaningful confidence prediction at all. This paper attempts to build this
idea in. I'm sure it's not the last word, but it's a good step in a line of
research that I think is very important.
