<p>We're here to help you understand and adopt AI.</p>
<p>At the Braneshop, we love all things AI. We spend our time
bringing diverse people into the field, and removing the barriers
for those that have faced them, so that the resulting technology
better reflects our communities, and addresses <em>all</em> our
needs.</p>
<p>We know that AI can be used for amazing things, but also that
there are many problems and potential solutions that won't be
discovered unless <em>everyone</em> is involved.</p>
<p>This is our vision: the powerful capabilities of AI in the hands
of us all.</p>
<p>We specialise in teaching these techniques in an intuitive and
hands-on way. Our workshops are organised in a group setting and
learning takes place through a mix of theory and practice.</p>

<div class="testimonials-list">
<div class="testimonial">
<div><img src="./images/real_testimonials/sam-small.jpg" alt=
"Sam" /></div>
<p>"The team at Braneshop create a learning environment that is
such a pleasant contrast to anything I've experienced at
university. Ruth and Noon, with the help of Esmeralda, create a
safe and inclusive space to learn, free of pressure or judgement.
Without scrimping on technical details, they manage to keep a
lighthearted and humorous atmosphere — the jokes are terrible but I
love them! I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is
keen on exploring deep learning surrounded by an interesting and
diverse group of people."<br />
<br />
— Samantha Floreani - Code Like A Girl</p>
</div>
<div class="testimonial alt">
<p>"I couldn't recommend this workshop more to anyone wanting to
get started with deep learning. It's fun, interactive and
informative. Deep learning is a relatively difficult subject but
Noon and Ruth make it easier to understand with lots of examples. I
really appreciate their patience in explaining and helping people
who have less technical background."<br />

<p>"[...] It has been a great learning experience so far with Ruth
and Noon who are fantastic in breaking down complex deep learning
concepts into readily understandable form. They have provided
specific direction on searching for relevant information regarding
ML/DL. Besides, the workshop is very engaging and participative
with lots of interactions between fellow participants. In addition
to learning, it has been a fantastic opportunity to network with
diverse community of participants. We have together designed a
neural network for image classification and coded it in TensorFlow
python which I am very happy about. [...] I am much more confident
and comfortable with Machine Learning/Deep Learning contents now
than I was before. I am looking forward to build machine learning
models that [are] applicable for genomic analysis. "<br />

<p>"I loved all the examples of AI in real life and I also found
the activity of working through the framework as a team on the
example we had. it has helped me understand the type of 'thinking'
and 'questioning' that needs to take place specifically for AI
that's different for other forms of tech. I also loved all the
simple and powerful visual diagrams in the workshop content. [...]
Personally I have a much greater understanding of AI and the role
it can play in organisations and the opportunity ahead.
Professionally I have more clarity on how to move forward with
helping organisations adopt AI from a people change
perspective."<br />

<p>"It's been wonderful to spend more time with Braneshop and [...]
learning about the different types of leaders out there wanting to
tackle AI! [...] The first part was particularly great, going
through at a fast pace the types of examples of different AI case
studies, particularly the machine-vision ones [...]"<br />

<p>"It's given me a greater understanding of AI and the way I can
implement it in my business including some of the challenges. [...]
It really challenged me to think outside the square! There's a lot
of thought that goes into designing an ai system which I was
unaware of. From UX to the business side, a lot needs to be
considered. The group exercises really helped break this down.

<h3><span>🌈 Our Values</span></h3>
<div class="hero-image"><img src=
"./images/workshop-action-photos/image7.jpg" alt=
"Our values" /></div>
<blockquote>"AI has the capability of providing something for
everybody, only because, and only when, it is created by
everybody.” ~ <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a>
<small>(She said "cities" instead of "AI", but it's
well-expressed!)</small></blockquote>
<div id="values-list">
<div class="value" id="value-1">
<h4>Empathy &amp; Ethics</h4>
<p>The software we write and algorithms we deploy will affect
people. We aim to be aware of potential impacts and create a
culture of empathetic ethical engineering.</p>
</div>
<div class="value" id="value-2">
<h4>Community &amp; Diversity</h4>
<p>We want to create a positive impact in our local community. We
believe that change is best driven locally, upwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="value" id="value-3">
<h4>Empowerment</h4>
<p>Skills allow for empowerment and can yield independence. By
building technical skills, we hope to enable others to make the
kind of change they want to see; change that benefits them and
their community.</p>
</div>
<div class="value" id="value-4">
<h4>Happiness</h4>
<p>Learning should be fun! We want people to come away from this
workshop feeling excited, happy and motivated to implement new
systems and processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="value" id="value-5">
<h4>Adaptability</h4>
<p>Each group of people comes to the Braneshop with different
skills, interests and abilities. We aim to be adaptable to the
groups we get, to engage with each individual on a personal level,
and present the material in a way that is meaningful, relatable and
intuitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="value" id="value-6">
<h4>Technical Excellence</h4>
<p>Programming is how we build deep learning networks, and as such
we believe it is important to ensure that they way we write and
structure the code is of a high quality. We spend a lot of time
making sure that we communicate ideas in code through strong coding
practices, which ensures that students have a strong foundation on
which to build future projects.</p>
