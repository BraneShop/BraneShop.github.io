    <p>We're here to help you understand and adopt AI.</p>


    <p> At the Braneshop, we love all things AI. We spend our time bringing
    diverse people into the field, and removing the barriers for those that
    have faced them, so that the resulting technology better reflects our
    communities, and addresses <em>all</em> our needs.
    </p>

    <p> We know that AI can be used for amazing things, but also that there
    are many problems and potential solutions that won't be discovered unless
    <em>everyone</em> is involved.
    </p>

    <p>This is our vision: the powerful capabilities of AI in the hands of
    us all.
    </p>

    <p>
    We specialise in teaching these techniques in an intuitive and hands-on
    way. Our workshops are organised in a group setting and learning takes
    place through a mix of theory and practice.

    <p>
    "The team at Braneshop create a learning environment that is such a pleasant
    contrast to anything I've experienced at university. Ruth and Noon, with the
    help of Esmeralda, create a safe and inclusive space to learn, free of
    pressure or judgement. Without scrimping on technical details, they manage to
    keep a lighthearted and humorous atmosphere &mdash; the jokes are terrible but I
    love them! I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is keen on
    exploring deep learning surrounded by an interesting and diverse group of
    people."

    "I couldn't recommend this workshop more to anyone wanting to get started
    with deep learning. It's fun, interactive and informative. Deep learning
    is a relatively difficult subject but Noon and Ruth make it easier to
    understand with lots of examples. I really appreciate their patience in
    explaining and helping people who have less technical background."

    <p>
    "[...] It has been a great learning experience so far with Ruth and Noon
    who are fantastic in breaking down complex deep learning concepts into
    readily understandable form. They have provided specific direction on
    searching for relevant information regarding ML/DL.  Besides, the
    workshop is very engaging and participative with lots of interactions
    between fellow participants. In addition to learning, it has been a
    fantastic opportunity to network with diverse community of participants.
    We have together designed a neural network for image classification and
    coded it in TensorFlow python which I am very happy about. [...] I am
    much more confident and comfortable with Machine Learning/Deep Learning
    contents now than I was before. I am looking forward to build machine
    learning models that [are] applicable for genomic analysis.

    "I loved all the examples of AI in real life and I also found the
    activity of working through the framework as a team on the example we
    had. it has helped me understand the type of 'thinking' and
    'questioning' that needs to take place specifically for AI that's
    different for other forms of tech. I also loved all the simple and
    powerful visual diagrams in the workshop content.  [...]
    Personally I have a much greater understanding of AI and the role it can
    play in organisations and the opportunity ahead. Professionally I have
    more clarity on how to move forward with helping organisations adopt AI
    from a people change perspective."

    "It's given me a greater understanding of AI and the way I can implement
    it in my business including some of the challenges.
    [...]
    It really challenged me to think outside the square! There's a lot of
    thought that goes into designing an ai system which I was unaware of.
    From UX to the business side, a lot needs to be considered. The group
    exercises really helped break this down.

  <h3> <span>🌈 Our Values</span> </h3>

  <div class="hero-image">
    <img src="./images/workshop-action-photos/image7.jpg" />
  </div> 

  <blockquote>"AI has the capability of providing something for everybody, only
  because, and only when, it is created by everybody.”  
  ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a>
  <small>(She said "cities" instead of "AI", but it's well-expressed!)</small>
  </blockquote>

  <div id="values-list">
    <div class="value" id="value-1">
      <h4> Empathy & Ethics </h4>
      <p> The software we write and algorithms we deploy will affect
          people. We aim to be aware of potential impacts and create
          a culture of empathetic ethical engineering.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-2">
      <h4> Community & Diversity</h4>
      <p> We want to create a positive impact in our local
          community. We believe that change is best driven
          locally, upwards.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-3">
      <h4> Empowerment </h4>
      <p> Skills allow for empowerment and can yield
      independence. By building technical skills, we
      hope to enable others to make the kind of change
      they want to see; change that benefits them and
      their community.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-4">
      <h4> Happiness </h4>
      <p> Learning should be fun! We want people to come
          away from this workshop feeling excited, 
          happy and motivated to implement new
          systems and processes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-5">
      <h4> Adaptability </h4>
      <p> Each group of people comes to the Braneshop
      with different skills, interests and abilities. We
      aim to be adaptable to the groups we get, to engage
      with each individual on a personal level, and present
      the material in a way that is meaningful, 
      relatable and intuitive.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value" id="value-6">
      <h4> Technical Excellence </h4>
      <p> 
      Programming is how we build deep learning networks, and as such we
      believe it is important to ensure that they way we write and structure
      the code is of a high quality. We spend a lot of time making sure that
      we communicate ideas in code through strong coding practices, which
      ensures that students have a strong foundation on which to build future
      projects.
