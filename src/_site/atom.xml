<p>Last year I put together <a href="https://silky.github.io/posts/2019-01-03-2018-books.html">a list of the books that I read</a>. I thought I‚Äôd keep the tradition going this year.</p>
<p>So, here we go, the books that I finished this year, in no particular order.</p>

<p>Gala and I went to the <a href="https://broadside.wheelercentre.com/">Broadside festival</a>, put on by the Wheeler Centre, last weekend. You can find people tweeting about it <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/broadside2019">here</a>. You can also find a cool image review by the <a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/news/broadside-2019-graphic-recording-gallery">Wheeler Centre themselves</a>.</p>
<p>The festival was billed as ‚ÄúAn unapologetically feminist agenda‚Äù; and it really delivered. Not only was it full of feminist views, those views were being shared by a quite diverse set of people.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final installment of this series, we look at a few of the ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù that will help us understand where we‚Äôre at as a business.</p>
<p>The main point here will be to list those patterns ‚Äî the patterns of behaviour, attitudes, business processes ‚Äî that we‚Äôd like to have at Braneshop.</p>
<p>The patterns should be <strong>measurable</strong> insofar as we ourselves will need to ask ourselves how well we‚Äôre doing when measuring ourselves on them. And we won‚Äôt be doing perfectly on each of them, and over the years we can expect our success across any given one to fluctuate. But that‚Äôs okay. The <i>process</i> is what is important.</p>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="/posts/Non-Technical-But-Detailed-Explanation-Of-Our-Business-Card-Designs.html">business card blog post</a> we love ‚ÄúCPPNs‚Äù here.</p>
<p>We wanted to share the fun, so I made a little JavaScript app where you can play around with them. You can access it here: <a href="https://silky.github.io/cppn-playground/">CPPN Playground</a>.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a few main things you can do:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Look at the cool pictures! And adjust the network to get more.</li>
<li>Train the network to reproduce a specific picture.</li>
<li>Download a big (1000x1000) version of the image!</li>

<i> <a href="https://events.humanitix.com.au/making-the-black-box-of-ai-transparent-with-explainable-ai-xai">Join us on the 6th of November for an Introduction to Explainable AI - Opening the black box!</a> </i>
</center>
<p>From talking to people across different businesses for the last few months, we know that there is significant interest in ‚Äúexaplainble‚Äù AI models. The reason is natural: When we deploy these decision-making tools, we need to understand <em>why</em> they make decisions; as this helps us learn if they are doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing. And furthermore, it let‚Äôs us improve or adjust our processes.</p>
<p>Our intention is to give you a high-level overview, and cover one or two areas in some detail, so you can get a feel for what‚Äôs involved.</p>
<p>As such, we‚Äôve organised an event to explore the landscape of Explainable AI. In particular, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at what‚Äôs available,</li>
<li>Work out what is involved in applying it,</li>
<li>and, Learn where the field is heading!</li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôre bringing together a few people in Melbourne who are doing interesting work in this area!</p>
<p>After attending this event, you should be able to understand:</p>

<p>As the year draws to a close, and Braneshop is almost a year old (woo!) we have been thinking a lot about our business goals. As such, I (Noon) have been having some discussions with different people and businesses about how Braneshop could align and/or collaborate with their businesses, naturally this has lead into a lot of conversations about where Braneshop is ‚Äúheading‚Äù.</p>
<p>The question is this: What kind of business is Braneshop? How do I see it changing over the years? What are our aims?</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while, I think it‚Äôs nicely captured by the idea of what I‚Äôm going to call ‚ÄúA Living Business‚Äù.</p>
<p>What does that mean?! In the following blog two blog posts, I‚Äôll talk about what inspired it and what it means to us. We welcome you to reach beyond the usual business comfort-zone and read on!</p>
<p>First up, in this post, we‚Äôll explore the inspirations. I start by introducing them and then end with what we define as ‚ÄúA Living Business‚Äù. (If you want to skip straight to the details, you may do so by clicking <a href="/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-2.html">here</a>.)</p>
