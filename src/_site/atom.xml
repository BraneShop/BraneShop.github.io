<h4 id="fires">Fires</h4>
<p>It’s been a terrible start of the year for Australia. I’ve been following the news over on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jan/08/nsw-fires-live-updates-victoria-bushfires-south-australia-fire-sa-australian-bushfire-near-me-rfs-cfa-latest-news-wednesday">The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As a result, we’ve decided to donate 50% of our profits</strong> (i.e. just less the venue costs and teaching time), from our two workshops in Feb. Hopefully this will be a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>If you want to do more, my friend Milly noted in a nice <a href="https://twitter.com/meelijane/status/1213251935035260928">thread</a> you can also remove your money from banks and superannuation firms that fund fossil fuel. <a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/responsible-banking/">Bank Australia</a> has been my choice. Finally, Gala and I have also gone through our house and found a bunch of things to give away.</p>
<p>Here’s some good links if you’re looking for places to donate:</p>

<p>Last year I put together <a href="https://silky.github.io/posts/2019-01-03-2018-books.html">a list of the books that I read</a>. I thought I’d keep the tradition going this year.</p>
<p>So, here we go, the books that I finished this year, in no particular order.</p>

<p>Gala and I went to the <a href="https://broadside.wheelercentre.com/">Broadside festival</a>, put on by the Wheeler Centre, last weekend. You can find people tweeting about it <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/broadside2019">here</a>. You can also find a cool image review by the <a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/news/broadside-2019-graphic-recording-gallery">Wheeler Centre themselves</a>.</p>
<p>The festival was billed as “An unapologetically feminist agenda”; and it really delivered. Not only was it full of feminist views, those views were being shared by a quite diverse set of people.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final installment of this series, we look at a few of the “patterns” that will help us understand where we’re at as a business.</p>
<p>The main point here will be to list those patterns — the patterns of behaviour, attitudes, business processes — that we’d like to have at Braneshop.</p>
<p>The patterns should be <strong>measurable</strong> insofar as we ourselves will need to ask ourselves how well we’re doing when measuring ourselves on them. And we won’t be doing perfectly on each of them, and over the years we can expect our success across any given one to fluctuate. But that’s okay. The <i>process</i> is what is important.</p>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="/posts/Non-Technical-But-Detailed-Explanation-Of-Our-Business-Card-Designs.html">business card blog post</a> we love “CPPNs” here.</p>
<p>We wanted to share the fun, so I made a little JavaScript app where you can play around with them. You can access it here: <a href="https://silky.github.io/cppn-playground/">CPPN Playground</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a few main things you can do:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Look at the cool pictures! And adjust the network to get more.</li>
<li>Train the network to reproduce a specific picture.</li>
<li>Download a big (1000x1000) version of the image!</li>

<i> <a href="https://events.humanitix.com.au/making-the-black-box-of-ai-transparent-with-explainable-ai-xai">Join us on the 6th of November for an Introduction to Explainable AI - Opening the black box!</a> </i>
</center>
<p>From talking to people across different businesses for the last few months, we know that there is significant interest in “exaplainble” AI models. The reason is natural: When we deploy these decision-making tools, we need to understand <em>why</em> they make decisions; as this helps us learn if they are doing the “right” thing. And furthermore, it let’s us improve or adjust our processes.</p>
<p>Our intention is to give you a high-level overview, and cover one or two areas in some detail, so you can get a feel for what’s involved.</p>
<p>As such, we’ve organised an event to explore the landscape of Explainable AI. In particular, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at what’s available,</li>
<li>Work out what is involved in applying it,</li>
<li>and, Learn where the field is heading!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re bringing together a few people in Melbourne who are doing interesting work in this area!</p>
<p>After attending this event, you should be able to understand:</p>
