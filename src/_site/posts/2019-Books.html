<p>Last year I put together <a href="https://silky.github.io/posts/2019-01-03-2018-books.html">a list of the books that I read</a>. I thought I’d keep the tradition going this year.</p>
<p>So, here we go, the books that I finished this year, in no particular order.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43821569-on-fire">On Fire: The Case for the Green New Deal</a></strong> by Klein, Naomi</p>
<p>
Amazing. I had never read anything by Naomi Klein before, which I now realise is a mistake. She’s awesome, and this book is very inspiring. Can’t say enough good things about it. Read it now!
</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79788.Community_and_Privacy">Community and Privacy: Toward a New Architecture of Humanism</a></strong> by Chermayeff, Serge</p>
<p>
A weird one, but good if you’re a fan of the work of Christopher Alexander and collaborators. I got a lot out of this, in terms of how to think about the relationships between “a list of tasks” and “a coherent grouping of those tasks into an atomic item”, but that’s an idea for another blog post.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46769012-refugee-rights-and-policy-wrongs">Refugee Rights and Policy Wrongs: A frank, up-to-date guide by experts</a></strong> by Chong, Fiona</p>
<p>
Great, and informative, and of course infuriating. I learned a lot about the policy around refugess, and just how unfair it is.
</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37806735-the-power-of-hope">The Power Of Hope</a></strong> by Karapanagiotidis, Kon</p>
<p>
Interesting read. Read this after visiting the ASRC a few months ago. I’m always inspired by people that dedicated their lives to helping people so fully.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23013953-gut">Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body’s Most Underrated Organ</a></strong> by Enders, Giulia</p>
<p>
Not bad. Has some practical advice and thoughts on gut health and bacteria.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="book">

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47491793-how-powerful-we-are">How Powerful We Are: Behind the scenes with one of Australia’s leading activists</a></strong> by Rugg, Sally</p>
<p>
Interesting behind-the-scenes view into the politics and campaigning around marriage equality. I think it’s always aggravatingly frustrating to hear what happens around these campaigns, but nice to know that there are good and thoughtful people involved.
</p>

<p>
Not bad; very quick read, I kind of like things like this, but only insofaras it agress with a lot of the other buddhism books I’ve been reading.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror">Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion</a></strong> by Tolentino, Jia</p>
<p>
Not bad. This was one of the books we picked up at the Broadside festival. It’s a nice collection of topical essays.
</p>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40365093-thick">Thick: And Other Essays</a></strong> by Cottom, Tressie McMillan</p>
<p>
Personally, I found most of these essays hard to relate to, but at least it was interesting to get a viewpoint that I don’t normally never have access to.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43427042-the-seven-necessary-sins-for-women-and-girls">The Seven Necessary Sins for Women and Girls</a></strong> by Eltahawy, Mona</p>
<p>
Amazing book, and again you should read this now! Mona has a very powerful viewpoint and message, and I like the way she communicates.
</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45449501-sand-talk">Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World</a></strong> by Yunkaporta, Tyson</p>
<p>
I found this one quirky, controversial, and a bit interesting. He makes some interesting points, and overall I think it’s a useful read, but it might be a bit too strange for a lot of people.
</p>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223297-permanent-record">Permanent Record</a></strong> by Snowden, Edward</p>
<p>
This book is very “american”, but I didn’t mind, and I find it very interesting to think of the kind of decisions Snowden had to make, and in effect making a moral decision that cost him his freedom. Worth reading.
</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39284186-no-friend-but-the-mountains">No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison</a></strong> by Boochani, Behrouz</p>
<p>
Really an amazing read. It blew my mind to learn that he wasn’t free at the time the book is published. This is really fascinating for what it reveals, and also the style of writing, combined with poetry, that I found really interesting.
</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40642337-solitary">Solitary</a></strong> by Woodfox, Albert</p>
<p>
I read this immediately following No Friend But the Mountains, and as a result it was a bit interesting. No Friend has a distinc style, and this one doesn’t, but this was a very revealing story for the kind of mistreatment that black people have suffered in America, and especially as it relates to the Black Panthers. Worth reading.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37976541-bad-blood">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a></strong> by Carreyrou, John</p>
<p>
I was just shocked basically the whole time I read this book. I’m amazed (kind of) that this company survived for so long. The main thing I learned from this book was to watch out for the fact that just because people you trust are on the Board of Directors, don’t trust the company! Maybe they are paid, or maybe they don’t know all the details. Horrible company. Worth reading.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23513349-milk-and-honey">Milk and Honey</a></strong> by Kaur, Rupi</p>

Poetry never used to be my thing, but this isn’t bad reading.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/815715.Start_Where_You_Are">Start Where You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living</a></strong> by Chödrön, Pema</p>
<p>
I really love this book, and all others by Pema. She has great thoughts on how to convert pain and suffering into tools for personal growth.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46742999-white-tears-brown-scars">White Tears/Brown Scars</a></strong> by Hamad, Ruby</p>
<p>
Amazing reading. In this book Ruby tackles the difficult topic of racism within feminism. Very much in line with the book of Mona; I got a quite a lot out of this book.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32950884-a-city-is-not-a-tree">A City is Not a Tree</a></strong> by Alexander, Christopher W.</p>
<p>
A sort, quirky one. Someone at a meetup I went to early in the year recommended it to me. Probably only worth reading from Christopher Alexander fans.
</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35099718-so-you-want-to-talk-about-race">So You Want to Talk About Race</a></strong> by Oluo, Ijeoma</p>
<p>
Pretty good. This was assigned as part of a book club at <a href="https://ochouse.com.au/">OC House</a>. I enjoyed it, and it has some useful tools for those who want to be able to talk confidently about race and racism.
</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women">Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men</a></strong> by Criado-Pérez, Caroline</p>
<p>
Amazing reading. Very relevant for the world of machine learning and AI. In particular this made me think a lot about when it’s appropriate to gather “sex-disaggregated” data (i.e. recording sex, or ignoring it). If you’re working in AI, definitely worth reading.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/687278.When_Things_Fall_Apart">When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times</a></strong> by Chödrön, Pema</p>
<p>
My favourite Pema Chödrön book, and suitable for every day life. I’ve lent this one to a friend, and I can’t wait to have it back so I can read it again!

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320553.Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a></strong> by Alexander, Christopher W.</p>
<p>
A cult classic among Christopher Alexander enthusiasts. It’s kind of hard reading, but it has a key point about abstraction and design and complexity that is really interesting, that I’m stilling trying to make sense of in my head.

<p>
I loved this books, and found them incredibly inspiring. They both convey the idea and importantance of indigenous and local knowledge, and the search for meaning in place. Very poetically written.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A very solid book, only for those really interested in the story of the Buddha. I found this book interesting and amusing. It’s funny to me to see the Buddha presented as a kind of “genius child” good at sports and thinking and sword-fighting. Despite that, I got a lot out of this book.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a></strong> by Graeber, David</p>
<p>
Another one that was assigned by the OC House reading group. I found it odd, but also quite fascinating. It covers the origin of money, and the idea of “the myth of barter”, which I believed myself, before reading this book.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068683-brave">Brave</a></strong> by McGowan, Rose</p>

Interesting and disturbing to read about Rose’s life, and the abuse she suffered in Hollywood. She’s an interesting person, and is just interested in making things better for people coming after her.

The Wheel of Time series were the first books I ever read, as an adult, so they have a special place in my heart, even though the books are a bit dated now. I enjoyed this simple prequel.
