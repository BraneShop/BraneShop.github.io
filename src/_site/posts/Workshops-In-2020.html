  <br /><small>Noon and Esmeralda, with their new banner, at the Datathon for Social Good!</small></p> </center>

<p>This year, we’ve been thinking about our prior workshops: what worked well, what what should change, and what we’d like to focus on this year.</p>
<p>A few ideas have emerged.</p>
<!--more-->
<h4 id="technical-workshop-on-the-10th-of-april"><a href="../technical-deep-learning-workshop.html">Technical Workshop</a> <small>(on the 10th of April)</small></h4>
<p><strong>#1 Smaller classes</strong></p>
<p>The idea is twofold. For our first workshop, we had 17 people and two instructors. We had people work in groups. I think this is a nice idea, but we found that the skill-level of people was quite varied, and teaming people up didn’t necessarly mean that they worked together well as a group, in terms of bringing everyone up to the same rough skill level.</p>
<p>We think that if we limit the number of attendees, say to six people per session, then we can <em>still</em> have two groups, but give closer attention and support to everyone. And furthermore, the skill variance should be smaller, so it will be easier to manage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, and importantly, <em>we can also change the workshop content</em> to suit the interests of the participants.</p>
<p>While we were able to do this a bit in the larger workshop, I’m sure that there are things we could’ve covered.</p>
<p><strong>#2 New schedule</strong></p>
<p>From chatting to a few people, I’ve learned that it’s probably inconvenient to do the workshop over <em>6 weeks</em>, where most of the time commitment is actually outside (typical) work hours.</p>
<p>So, we’ve decided to drop the workshop down to two eight-hour days, <em>followed by</em> an afternoon post-workshop session. The eight hour days roughly cover the original content, and the final afternoon is intended as a kind of project kick-off session. The idea is that either you bring something you want to work on, and we get started together; or you work through one of our projects that we’ve thought of; that explores a particular aspect of deep learning.</p>
<p>We’ve also put the workshop so that it has a weekend during the middle of the two days.</p>
<h4 id="ai-for-leadership-workshop-on-the-23rd-of-march"><a href="../ai-for-leadership.html">AI For Leadership Workshop</a> <small>(on the 23rd of March)</small></h4>
<p>We’ve run a few of these now, and overall they’re going well. The one-day format works really nicely, and having a group of about 10 people allows for really interesting exchanges and interactions, as well as good group activities.</p>
<p>We won’t really be changing a lot, but there are some thoughts floating around of other areas to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms/Hardware: Should we build or buy? What are the pros/cons?</li>
<li>Tools: What’s good? How should we adopt it?</li>
<li>Case studies: What are other companies doing out there?</li>
</ul>
<p>We already cover a few case studies, but we’ll try and add in a few more.</p>
<p>I also want to allow this workshop to develop along the interests of the attendees, so perhaps we’ll find a way to work in a bit of the themes of the afternoon session from the tech workshop into this format. I.e. a “BYO Problem” discussion section.</p>
<h4 id="overall">Overall</h4>
<p>In general, we’re keen to learn and adapt to what works, and what helps us build a sustainable business.</p>
<p>We’re always interested in hearing from you, in any capacity, about what is of interest, what would suit you best, and what kinds of formats works well.</p>
<p>Overall, our aim remains the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring more people into the AI industry,</li>
<li>Support people with their AI projects,</li>
<li>Push the AI field in a much ethical/sustainable direction,</li>
<li>Engage with people and projects we love, that are doing good out in the world!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any thoughts, <a href="../contact.html">please send them our way!</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, if you’d like to join a workshop, but have some specific needs that we’re not meeting, or concerns that are holding you back, please reach out! We’ll do our best to help.</p>
