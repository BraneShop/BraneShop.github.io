<p> <em class="tag">A six-week hands-on deep learning workshop for
those wanting to break into the AI industry.</em> </p>
<h5>About</h5>

<p> Over <b>6 weeks</b>, with <b>3 contact hours per week</b>, you will get to
grips with deep learning through Python, TensorFlow and Google Colaboratory.
This is a hands-on technical workshop, with a substantial programming
component.

<!--
Our experienced <a href="/team.html">instructors</a> will work closely to
support you to gain an intuitive understanding of deep learning, and hands-on
experience in solving problems across typical domains of deep learning, such
as understanding images, videos, text, and learning to harness the structure
within "raw" datasets. </p>
-->


<h5 class="s">What can you expect to receive and achieve?</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>An intuitive understanding of deep learning and the essential concepts,</li>
<li>Hands-on work in solving problems,</li>
<li>Experience building models for typical domains of deep learning: understanding images,
  videos, and text,</li>
<li>Individual and group support,</li>
<li>Completed a selection of projects in TensorFlow,</li>
<li>A supportive and growing community during and after the workshop.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="s">Every week we will ...</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>Have group discussions and learn together in a collaborative way,</li>
<li>Consolidate your knowledge through exercises,</li>
<li>Build on work from previous weeks through homework,</li>
<li>Provide <em>additional</em>  support (other than teaching hours) through office hours.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="s">Who's it for?</h5>
<ul class="normal">
<li>Data scientists wishing to move into AI and deep learning,</li>
<li>Programmers looking to build, work with, or otherwise work with AI or deep learning projects,</li>
<li>and broadly, technical people looking to break into the AI industry,
  develop a new business or product, join an existing AI team, or generally
  contribute to the AI ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We welcome people from a variety of backgrounds. To ensure success in the
workshop, a minimum level of Python programming is required, but this is
self-assessed, using <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/VncQkZLylzh8JWez1">this
quiz</a>.

    <p>
    "The team at Braneshop create a learning environment that is such a pleasant
    contrast to anything I've experienced at university. Ruth and Noon, with the
    help of Esmeralda, create a safe and inclusive space to learn, free of
    pressure or judgement. Without scrimping on technical details, they manage to
    keep a lighthearted and humorous atmosphere &mdash; the jokes are terrible but I
    love them! I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is keen on
    exploring deep learning surrounded by an interesting and diverse group of
    people."

    "I couldn't recommend this workshop more to anyone wanting to get started
    with deep learning. It's fun, interactive and informative. Deep learning
    is a relatively difficult subject but Noon and Ruth make it easier to
    understand with lots of examples. I really appreciate their patience in
    explaining and helping people who have less technical background."

    <p>
    "[...] It has been a great learning experience so far with Ruth and Noon
    who are fantastic in breaking down complex deep learning concepts into
    readily understandable form. They have provided specific direction on
    searching for relevant information regarding ML/DL.  Besides, the
    workshop is very engaging and participative with lots of interactions
    between fellow participants. In addition to learning, it has been a
    fantastic opportunity to network with diverse community of participants.
    We have together designed a neural network for image classification and
    coded it in TensorFlow python which I am very happy about. [...] I am
    much more confident and comfortable with Machine Learning/Deep Learning
    contents now than I was before. I am looking forward to build machine
    learning models that [are] applicable for genomic analysis.
