<p>Gala and I went to the <a href="https://broadside.wheelercentre.com/">Broadside festival</a>, put on by the Wheeler Centre, last weekend. You can find people tweeting about it <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/broadside2019">here</a>. You can also find a cool image review by the <a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/news/broadside-2019-graphic-recording-gallery">Wheeler Centre themselves</a>.</p>
<p>The festival was billed as “An unapologetically feminist agenda”; and it really delivered. Not only was it full of feminist views, those views were being shared by a quite diverse set of people.</p>

  <br /><small>Rough grouping of <i>Patterns</i> for Braneshop.</small></p> </center>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final installment of this series, we look at a few of the “patterns” that will help us understand where we’re at as a business.</p>
<p>The main point here will be to list those patterns — the patterns of behaviour, attitudes, business processes — that we’d like to have at Braneshop.</p>
<p>The patterns should be <strong>measurable</strong> insofar as we ourselves will need to ask ourselves how well we’re doing when measuring ourselves on them. And we won’t be doing perfectly on each of them, and over the years we can expect our success across any given one to fluctuate. But that’s okay. The <i>process</i> is what is important.</p>

  <br /><small>The main interface of the CPPN playground; reproducing a cool rendering of a black hole.</small></p> </center>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="/posts/Non-Technical-But-Detailed-Explanation-Of-Our-Business-Card-Designs.html">business card blog post</a> we love “CPPNs” here.</p>
<p>We wanted to share the fun, so I made a little JavaScript app where you can play around with them. You can access it here: <a href="https://silky.github.io/cppn-playground/">CPPN Playground</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a few main things you can do:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Look at the cool pictures! And adjust the network to get more.</li>
<li>Train the network to reproduce a specific picture.</li>
<li>Download a big (1000x1000) version of the image!</li>
</ol>

    <title>Introduction to Explainable AI - 6th of Nov, 2019</title>

  <br /><small>Join us for an evening of Explainable AI!</small></p> </center>

<center>
<i> <a href="https://events.humanitix.com.au/making-the-black-box-of-ai-transparent-with-explainable-ai-xai">Join us on the 6th of November for an Introduction to Explainable AI - Opening the black box!</a> </i>
</center>
<p>From talking to people across different businesses for the last few months, we know that there is significant interest in “exaplainble” AI models. The reason is natural: When we deploy these decision-making tools, we need to understand <em>why</em> they make decisions; as this helps us learn if they are doing the “right” thing. And furthermore, it let’s us improve or adjust our processes.</p>
<p>Our intention is to give you a high-level overview, and cover one or two areas in some detail, so you can get a feel for what’s involved.</p>
<p>As such, we’ve organised an event to explore the landscape of Explainable AI. In particular, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at what’s available,</li>
<li>Work out what is involved in applying it,</li>
<li>and, Learn where the field is heading!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re bringing together a few people in Melbourne who are doing interesting work in this area!</p>
<p>After attending this event, you should be able to understand:</p>

  <br /><small>Inspirations for a different way of thinking about the Braneshop business.</small></p> </center>

<p>As the year draws to a close, and Braneshop is almost a year old (woo!) we have been thinking a lot about our business goals. As such, I (Noon) have been having some discussions with different people and businesses about how Braneshop could align and/or collaborate with their businesses, naturally this has lead into a lot of conversations about where Braneshop is “heading”.</p>
<p>The question is this: What kind of business is Braneshop? How do I see it changing over the years? What are our aims?</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while, I think it’s nicely captured by the idea of what I’m going to call “A Living Business”.</p>
<p>What does that mean?! In the following blog two blog posts, I’ll talk about what inspired it and what it means to us. We welcome you to reach beyond the usual business comfort-zone and read on!</p>
<p>First up, in this post, we’ll explore the inspirations. I start by introducing them and then end with what we define as “A Living Business”. (If you want to skip straight to the details, you may do so by clicking <a href="/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-2.html">here</a>.)</p>

    <title>Non-Technical, But Detailed, Explanation of Our Business Card Designs!</title>

  <br /><small>An assorted collection of our new business cards!</small></p> </center>

<p>Our new business cards arrived earlier this week, and since showing them around to a few people and getting some very nice feedback, I thought it might be of interest to talk a bit about how they were made.</p>
<p>In particular I wanted to aim this discussion at people who are not intimately familiar with making graphics on computers.</p>
<p>Let’s get into it!</p>

  <p>Watch on Vimeo - <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/349597581">Note on scholarships.</a></p>
</center>



<p>Ruth and I are very pleased to be offering scholarships for our workshop coming up on the 8th of August. We’ve already accept first-round scholarships (6 people), and so there are some remaining places.</p>
<p>We’re encouraging applications from anyone that has typically faced barriers in their career/learning in the tech industry. One of our big aims at Braneshop is to increase the representation in the AI industry, and this is one way we’re working towards that goal.</p>
<p>You can find the application form here: <a href="https://noonvandersilk.typeform.com/to/Tnfm4a">Scholarship for the 6 Week Technical Deep Learning Workshop</a>, and of course more details about the workshop itself here: <a href="/6-week-workshop-on-deep-learning.html">6 Week Workshop</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve also got a scholarship for the <a href="/ai-for-leadership.html">AI For Leadership Workshop</a>, coming up in September. This is an important one for us as well, as, in order to see change broadly through-out the industry, we will need change in leadership positions.</p>
<p>Here at the Braneshop we’re creating a welcoming and supportive community for everyone to be involved in AI. We hope you join us!</p>
