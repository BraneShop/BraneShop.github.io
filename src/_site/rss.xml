    <title>Post-Prediction Unconference!</title>
    <link>https://braneshop.com.au/posts/Post-Prediction-Unconference-2020.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[


<p>We‚Äôre very excited to be co-orgainising the first ‚Äú<a href="https://postpredictionconference.github.io/">Post-Prediction</a>‚Äù unconference next month, Feb 18th (a Tuesday).</p>
<p>The event was conceived while I was reading this book ‚Äî <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> by Shoshana Zuboff.</p>
<p>Notably, in the book, Shoshana brings up the problem of how we, as a society, will deal with the (coming, but also already present) motivations of behavioural change that ‚Äúultimately-predictive‚Äù abilities will give us.</p>
<p>So, this unconference is centered around this idea, with a particular focus/interest on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empathy and ethics, bias and fairness,</li>
<li>Projects for social good,</li>
<li>Creative applications,</li>
<li>Inclusion and community-building,</li>
<li>Teaching and education,</li>
<li>Journalism and story-telling,</li>
<li>Privacy and security,</li>
<li>Sustainability,</li>
<li>Data governance,</li>
<li>Human-in-the-loop systems,</li>
<li>The UI the experience of AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the event is running in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> style, and that means it will be entirely driven by those present. The focus will all be on engaging with <em>each other</em>, on topics that we agree upon on the day.</p>
<p>We have three (pretty big) rooms to work with, so there will be plenty of space to work together.</p>
<p>Roughly, the way it will work is, we write up on the whiteboard things we want to talk about, then talk about that!</p>
<p>To make things concrete, here‚Äôs some things I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôd like to see/discuss:</p>

    <title>Workshops, Fires, New computer, and a Datathon!</title>
    <link>https://braneshop.com.au/posts/2020-Workshops-Fires-New-Computer.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[


<h4 id="fires">Fires</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs been a terrible start of the year for Australia. I‚Äôve been following the news over on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jan/08/nsw-fires-live-updates-victoria-bushfires-south-australia-fire-sa-australian-bushfire-near-me-rfs-cfa-latest-news-wednesday">The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As a result, we‚Äôve decided to donate 50% of our profits</strong> (i.e.¬†just less the venue costs and teaching time), from our two workshops in Feb and March. Hopefully this will be a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>If you want to do more, my friend Milly noted in a nice <a href="https://twitter.com/meelijane/status/1213251935035260928">thread</a> you can also remove your money from banks and superannuation firms that fund fossil fuel. <a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/responsible-banking/">Bank Australia</a> has been my choice. Finally, Gala and I have also gone through our house and found a bunch of things to give away.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs some good links if you‚Äôre looking for places to donate:</p>

    <title>2019 Books</title>

    <description><![CDATA[


<p>Last year I put together <a href="https://silky.github.io/posts/2019-01-03-2018-books.html">a list of the books that I read</a>. I thought I‚Äôd keep the tradition going this year.</p>
<p>So, here we go, the books that I finished this year, in no particular order.</p>

    <title>Broadside 2019 Debrief</title>
    <link>https://braneshop.com.au/posts/Broadside-Debrief.html</link>

  <br /><small>Our haul of books from the Broadside book shop!</small></p> </center>

<p>Gala and I went to the <a href="https://broadside.wheelercentre.com/">Broadside festival</a>, put on by the Wheeler Centre, last weekend. You can find people tweeting about it <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/broadside2019">here</a>. You can also find a cool image review by the <a href="https://www.wheelercentre.com/news/broadside-2019-graphic-recording-gallery">Wheeler Centre themselves</a>.</p>
<p>The festival was billed as ‚ÄúAn unapologetically feminist agenda‚Äù; and it really delivered. Not only was it full of feminist views, those views were being shared by a quite diverse set of people.</p>

    <title>Braneshop &mdash; "A Living Business" - Part 3 of 3</title>
    <link>https://braneshop.com.au/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-3.html</link>

  <br /><small>Rough grouping of <i>Patterns</i> for Braneshop.</small></p> </center>

<ul class="normal">
<li>
<a href="/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-1.html">Part 1 of 3 - Inspiration</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-2.html">Part 2 of 3 - The Idea: A Living Business</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-3.html">Part 3 of 3 - Patterns for Braneshop</a> (this page)
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final installment of this series, we look at a few of the ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù that will help us understand where we‚Äôre at as a business.</p>
<p>The main point here will be to list those patterns ‚Äî the patterns of behaviour, attitudes, business processes ‚Äî that we‚Äôd like to have at Braneshop.</p>
<p>The patterns should be <strong>measurable</strong> insofar as we ourselves will need to ask ourselves how well we‚Äôre doing when measuring ourselves on them. And we won‚Äôt be doing perfectly on each of them, and over the years we can expect our success across any given one to fluctuate. But that‚Äôs okay. The <i>process</i> is what is important.</p>

  <br /><small>The main interface of the CPPN playground; reproducing a cool rendering of a black hole.</small></p> </center>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="/posts/Non-Technical-But-Detailed-Explanation-Of-Our-Business-Card-Designs.html">business card blog post</a> we love ‚ÄúCPPNs‚Äù here.</p>
<p>We wanted to share the fun, so I made a little JavaScript app where you can play around with them. You can access it here: <a href="https://silky.github.io/cppn-playground/">CPPN Playground</a>.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a few main things you can do:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Look at the cool pictures! And adjust the network to get more.</li>
<li>Train the network to reproduce a specific picture.</li>
<li>Download a big (1000x1000) version of the image!</li>
</ol>
