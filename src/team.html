  <h3>â˜• Team</h3>

  <p> Our trainers have experience in consulting, research, software
  engineering, teaching, data science, AI engineering, and specifically in
  working to build deep learning systems for a wide range of clients. We bring
  that experience, together with strong pedagogical practices to present
  workshops in an intuitive, hands-on, collaborative and practical way. </p>

  <p> Here at the Braneshop we pride ourselves on our style of teaching and
  the way we engage with people during the workshop. Our aim is to have people
  learn collaboratively, and empower them to become experts at forming
  solutions and problem-solving within the domain of AI. </p>

        <p> <b>Esmeralda Garmar</b> is the community and business development manager
          at Braneshop.</p>

        <p> After a few years working in the architecture space, Esmeralda
        believed she needed another degree - a bachelor of life. She packed up
        and travelled the world for more than half a decade - a digital nomad
        - doing all kinds of remote jobs, and organising people, like her, who
        wanted to work remote and enjoyed being around other professionals.
        These experiences nourished her entrepreneurial spirit and fed
        goodness to her mind.
        </p>
        <p>She learned to empathise with local communities,
        developed a local-first approach in order to work ethically with
        different people around the world, and grew into a person who is able
        to work with and in a diverse range of environments and people.
        Esmeralda thrives on making genuine relationships with the people she
        meets, and as such she is now working with braneshop 
        to engage with the community.
