Hello friends!

This is your first Braneshop blog post from me, and I’m very excited to be
writing it to tell you about our first [6 Week Technical Deep Learning
Workshop](/6-week-workshop-on-deep-learning.html) scheduled to start on the
8th of August, which is [on sale
now!](https://events.humanitix.com.au/braneshop-6-week-technical-deep-learning-workshop)

(Not to mention our first [AI for
 Leadership](/ai-for-leadership.html) workshop which is
 also on sale now, and our [Intensive Technical Deep Learning
 Workshop](/deep-learning-workshop.html)
 which we
 can bring to your organisation &mdash; [get in
 touch!](https://noonvandersilk.typeform.com/to/DYKvWN))

I recently joined my friend Noon at Braneshop as an instructor, here’s why:

1. I love demystifying science into simple concepts to make it fun and
   accessible to people like you.

2. As a queer woman in the AI industry, I don’t see many people who look like
   me and I know how intimidating that can be. I’m here to help people from
   diverse backgrounds and be a part of the platform that elevates their
   skills and representation.

3. Noon has a lot of experience teaching technical content and we love
   working, learning and collaborating together.

I come from an academic physics background and I learnt code in order to do my
research.  This commonly leads to sloppy coding and bad habits.  I can’t say
I’m completely cured (the physicist will be forever inside me!) but five years
of working in tech has got me mostly straightened out in terms of writing nice
code. More importantly, from working in data science and AI I have learnt the
tools, tips and tricks that make the job easy and fun.  

Academia is just one way into AI, there are actually as many ways as you could
care to count.  This is fantastic news, since it is so important to bring a
diverse and interdisciplinary approach to AI tools which are becoming so
prevalent in our world.  There are lots of great resources online, and many of
you will already be using AI in your lives and work, whether you realise it or
not. Whichever path has brought you to this interest in AI, our workshop will
give you hands on learning and leave you more confident to continue in the
industry.  My colleague and friend, Noon, has a very strong tech background,
so between the two of us we’ve got all your needs catered for in our
workshop.

In fact, many concepts we will cover in the workshop once felt foreign and
scary to me, I picked them up bit by bit. And so can you. They actually aren’t
scary at all, you just need someone to explain them to you in a logical way,
starting from the basics. That’s what we’re here for. 

It’s surprising how much you realise you know when someone is willing to join
the dots for you. We’re ready to be your dot joiners!  Come!  Bring your dots!
Let us join them!
