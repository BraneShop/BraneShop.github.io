From talking to people in various industries, we know that there is
significant interested in "exaplainble" AI models. The reason is natural: When
we deploy these decision-making tools, we need to understand _why_ they make
decisions; as this helps us learn if they are doing the "right" thing. And
furthermore, it let's us improve or adjust our processes.

As such, we've organised an event to explore the landscape of Explainable AI. In
particular, we will:

- Look at what's available,
- Work out what is involved in applying it,
- and, Learn where the field is heading!

We're bringing together a few people in Melbourne who are doing interesting
work in this area.
