From talking to people across different businesses for the last few months, we
know that there is significant interest in "exaplainble" AI models. The reason
is natural: When we deploy these decision-making tools, we need to understand
_why_ they make decisions; as this helps us learn if they are doing the
"right" thing. And furthermore, it let's us improve or adjust our processes.

Our intention is to give you a high-level overview, and cover one or two areas
in some detail, so you can get a feel for what's involved.

As such, we've organised an event to explore the landscape of Explainable AI. In
particular, we will:

- Look at what's available,
- Work out what is involved in applying it,
- and, Learn where the field is heading!

We're bringing together a few people in Melbourne who are doing interesting
work in this area!

After attending this event, you should be able to understand:

<!--more-->

- What is Explainable AI (XAI)?
- Who is using it?
- How well does it work?
- What are the alternatives?
- How can I get started?

So if you've got an interest in using and building that AI is understandable,
please join us!

The event is by donation only, and you can grab tickets over on [Humanitix -
