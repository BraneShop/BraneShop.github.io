Last week we helped organise the first [Post-Prediction
Conference](https://postpredictionconference.github.io/). We organised it as an
Unconference.

The event went amazingly well! We had a really diverse and interesting, and
interested attendees, who were ready to discuss a wide-ranging series of
topics all relating to _what we do_ when we have powerful AIs at our disposal.

Let's break-down how things went.

### Breakdown

Firstly, I'd like to thank everyone who donated money to attend the
conference.

We raised $747.00 for bush fire relief, which was donated to the [Australian
Wildlife Conservancy](https://www.givenow.com.au/australianwildlife) via
[GiveNow](https://www.givenow.com.au/).

<br /><small>Note: it says we donated more because we covered the cost of donation
via GiveNow.</small></center>

#### Topics

[Arna](https://www.arnakarick.com/) is putting together a full "proceedings"
for the conference, so we'll include that here when it's ready.

Roughly, from my memory, we covered:

<ul class="normal">
<li>AI and the climate</li>
<li>AI, mental health and healthcare</li>
<li>Post-Human Literature</li>
<li>Ethics & The Ethics Canvas & [Ethical Litmus Test](ethical-litmus.site)</li>
<li>Creative AI Techniques</li>
<li>AI and Music</li>
<li>AI v.s. Humans</li>
<li>AI in education and translating research</li>
</ul>


#### Attendees

Of course, the best part was the attendees. Many people have said that it
didn't "feel" like a normal tech event, because the crowd was so diverse.
Hopefully, that will change over the years, as the tech and AI industry in
particular improves.

It was amazing for me, personally, to meet so many new people, and gain an
insight into how others think and talk about AI.

Regarding the diversity, there were a few people who asked about how we
achieved this. 

Here's my thoughts:

- We had a diverse set of organisers
- We promoted to _our own_ networks; i.e. a diverse set of networks
- People self-selected to attend based on the established themes


#### Conclusion

Due to the positive feedback; we'll definitely be running this event again
next year.

The rough plan is to organise a _two-day_ conference next time, with the first
day being planned talks, and the _second_ day being the same unconference
format.
