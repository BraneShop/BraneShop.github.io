We're very grateful to the very nice people at <a
href="https://thebluerock.com.au/" rel="noopener">BlueRock</a> (be sure to
check out their website!)  who have agreed to be our venue hosts for the
upcoming <a
href="/6-week-workshop-on-deep-learning.html">6 week
technical deep learning workshop</a>, kicking off on the 8th of August!

The office is right next to <a

rel="noopener">flag staff station</a>, so it's a very convenient location for
us. It's a nice big board room that we'll be able to arrange in a nice way for
our group-style format.

We look forward to seeing you there!
