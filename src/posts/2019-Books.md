Last year I put together [a list of the books that I
read](https://silky.github.io/posts/2019-01-03-2018-books.html). I thought I'd
keep the tradition going this year.

So, here we go, the books that I finished this year, in no particular order.

#### Fiction

   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43821569-on-fire">On Fire: The Case for the Green New Deal</a></strong> by Klein, Naomi

   <p>Amazing. I had never read anything by Naomi Klein before, which I now
   realise is a mistake. She's awesome, and this book is very inspiring. Can't
   say enough good things about it. Read it now!
   </p>

  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power</a></strong> by Zuboff, Shoshana

   <p>Incredible book. Amazingly well-researched, and highlights many issues
   that have bothered me for many years, but I've never been able to express
   well. It's a huge read, but absolutely worth your time. Highly recommended
   to anyone working in AI or with data and people.
   </p>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/0.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79788.Community_and_Privacy">Community and Privacy: Toward a New Architecture of Humanism</a></strong> by Chermayeff, Serge

   <p>A weird one, but good if you're a fan of the work of Christopher
   Alexander and collaborators. I got a lot out of this, in terms of how to
   think about the relationships between "a list of tasks" and "a coherent
   grouping of those tasks into an atomic item", but that's an idea for
   another blog post.
   </p>
  </div>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/2.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46769012-refugee-rights-and-policy-wrongs">Refugee Rights and Policy Wrongs: A frank, up-to-date guide by experts</a></strong> by Chong, Fiona

   <p>Great, and informative, and of course infuriating. I learned a lot about
   the policy around refugess, and just how unfair it is.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/3.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37806735-the-power-of-hope">The Power Of Hope</a></strong> by Karapanagiotidis, Kon

   <p>Interesting read. Read this after visiting the ASRC a few months ago.
   I'm always inspired by people that dedicated their lives to helping people
   so fully.
   </p>
  </div>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/4.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23013953-gut">Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body’s Most Underrated Organ</a></strong> by Enders, Giulia

   <p>Not bad. Has some practical advice and thoughts on gut health and
   bacteria.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/6.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47491793-how-powerful-we-are">How Powerful We Are: Behind the scenes with one of Australia's leading activists</a></strong> by Rugg, Sally

   <p>Interesting behind-the-scenes view into the politics and campaigning
   around marriage equality. I think it's always aggravatingly frustrating
   to hear what happens around these campaigns, but nice to know that there
   are good and thoughtful people involved.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/7.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57857.The_Tao_of_Leadership">The Tao of Leadership: Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching Adapted for a New Age</a></strong> by Heider, John

   <p>Not bad; very quick read, I kind of like things like this, but only
   insofaras it agress with a lot of the other buddhism books I've been
   reading.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/8.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror">Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion</a></strong> by Tolentino, Jia

   <p>Not bad. This was one of the books we picked up at the Broadside
   festival. It's a nice collection of topical essays.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/10.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40365093-thick">Thick: And Other Essays</a></strong> by Cottom, Tressie McMillan

   <p>Personally, I found most of these essays hard to relate to, but at least
   it was interesting to get a viewpoint that I don't normally never have
   access to.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/11.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43427042-the-seven-necessary-sins-for-women-and-girls">The Seven Necessary Sins for Women and Girls</a></strong> by Eltahawy, Mona

   <p>Amazing book, and again you should read this now! Mona has a very
   powerful viewpoint and message, and I like the way she communicates.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/13.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45449501-sand-talk">Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World</a></strong> by Yunkaporta, Tyson

   <p>I found this one quirky, controversial, and a bit interesting. He makes
   some interesting points, and overall I think it's a useful read, but it
   might be a bit too strange for a lot of people.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/14.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223297-permanent-record">Permanent Record</a></strong> by Snowden, Edward

   <p>This book is very "american", but I didn't mind, and I find it very
   interesting to think of the kind of decisions Snowden had to make, and in
   effect making a moral decision that cost him his freedom. Worth reading.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>



<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/20.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39284186-no-friend-but-the-mountains">No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison</a></strong> by Boochani, Behrouz

   <p>Really an amazing read. It blew my mind to learn that he wasn't free at
   the time the book is published. This is really fascinating for what it
   reveals, and also the style of writing, combined with poetry, that I found
   really interesting.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/21.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40642337-solitary">Solitary</a></strong> by Woodfox, Albert

   <p>I read this immediately following No Friend But the Mountains, and as a
   result it was a bit interesting. No Friend has a distinc style, and this
   one doesn't, but this was a very revealing story for the kind of
   mistreatment that black people have suffered in America, and especially as
   it relates to the Black Panthers. Worth reading.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/38.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37976541-bad-blood">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a></strong> by Carreyrou, John

   <p>I was just shocked basically the whole time I read this book. I'm amazed
   (kind of) that this company survived for so long. The main thing I learned
   from this book was to watch out for the fact that just because people you
   trust are on the Board of Directors, don't trust the company! Maybe they
   are paid, or maybe they don't know all the details. Horrible company. Worth
   reading.
   </p>
  </div>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/44.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23513349-milk-and-honey">Milk and Honey</a></strong> by Kaur, Rupi

   <p>Poetry never used to be my thing, but this isn't bad reading.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/47.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/815715.Start_Where_You_Are">Start Where You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living</a></strong> by Chödrön, Pema

   <p> I really love this book, and all others by Pema. She has great thoughts on
   how to convert pain and suffering into tools for personal growth.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/48.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46742999-white-tears-brown-scars">White Tears/Brown Scars</a></strong> by Hamad, Ruby

   <p>Amazing reading. In this book Ruby tackles the difficult topic of racism
   within feminism. Very much in line with the book of Mona; I got a quite a
   lot out of this book.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/49.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32950884-a-city-is-not-a-tree">A City is Not a Tree</a></strong> by Alexander, Christopher W.

   <p>A sort, quirky one. Someone at a meetup I went to early in the year
   recommended it to me. Probably only worth reading from Christopher
   Alexander fans.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/50.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35099718-so-you-want-to-talk-about-race">So You Want to Talk About Race</a></strong> by Oluo, Ijeoma

   <p>Pretty good. This was assigned as part of a book club at [OC
   House](https://ochouse.com.au/). I enjoyed it, and it has some useful tools
   for those who want to be able to talk confidently about race and racism.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/51.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women">Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men</a></strong> by Criado-Pérez, Caroline

   <p>Amazing reading. Very relevant for the world of machine learning and AI.
   In particular this made me think a lot about when it's appropriate to
   gather "sex-disaggregated" data (i.e. recording sex, or ignoring it). If
   you're working in AI, definitely worth reading.
   </p>
  </div>

<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/53.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/687278.When_Things_Fall_Apart">When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times</a></strong> by Chödrön, Pema

   <p>My favourite Pema Chödrön book, and suitable for every day life. I've
   lent this one to a friend, and I can't wait to have it back so I can read it again!
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/54.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320553.Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a></strong> by Alexander, Christopher W.

   <p>A cult classic among Christopher Alexander enthusiasts. It's kind of
   hard reading, but it has a key point about abstraction and design and
   complexity that is really interesting, that I'm stilling trying to make
   sense of in my head.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/55.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/56.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16878.Arctic_Dreams">Arctic Dreams</a></strong>
   and <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15259073-horizon">Horizon</a></strong> by Lopez, Barry

   <p>I loved this books, and found them incredibly inspiring. They both
   convey the idea and importantance of indigenous and local knowledge, and
   the search for meaning in place. Very poetically written.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>




<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/57.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241899.Old_Path_White_Clouds">Old Path White Clouds: Walking in the Footsteps of the Buddha</a></strong> by Thích Nhất Hạnh

   <p>A very solid book, only for those really interested in the story of the
   Buddha. I found this book interesting and amusing. It's funny to me to see
   the Buddha presented as a kind of "genius child" good at sports and
   thinking and sword-fighting. Despite that, I got a lot out of this book.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/58.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a></strong> by Graeber, David

   <p>Another one that was assigned by the OC House reading group. I found it
   odd, but also quite fascinating. It covers the origin of money, and the
   idea of "the myth of barter", which I believed myself, before reading this
   book.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/59.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068683-brave">Brave</a></strong> by McGowan, Rose

   <p>Interesting and disturbing to read about Rose's life, and the abuse she
   suffered in Hollywood. She's an interesting person, and is just interested
   in making things better for people coming after her.
   </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="book">
  <div class="img"><img src="/images/2019-reading/60.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39703115-the-guilty-feminist">The Guilty Feminist: From Our Noble Goals to Our Worst Hypocrisies</a></strong> by Frances-white, Deborah

   <p>Funny and enjoyable reading. I definitely have my own guilty feminist moments.
   </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187065.New_Spring">New Spring (Wheel of Time, #0)</a></strong> by Jordan, Robert

   <p>The Wheel of Time series were the first books I ever read, as an adult,
   so they have a special place in my heart, even though the books are a bit
   dated now. I enjoyed this simple prequel.</p>

   <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts">Redshirts</a></strong> by Scalzi, John

   <p>Wasn't a big fan of this one. The idea was good, but the book itself was
   quite sexist, and ultimately a bit boring.
   </p>

   was explored in an interesting way.</p>
