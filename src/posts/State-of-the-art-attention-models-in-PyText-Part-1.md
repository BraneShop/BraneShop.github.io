preview: PyText is a relatively recent library from Facebook Research that allows people to try out a variety of text models. Let's use it to compute some state-of-the-art attention models!
---

I wanted to take some time to discuss a library that seems to have flown under
the radar a little bit. It's called
[PyText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext), and we're going to
explore how you can use it to run state of the art attention models!

Here's our plan:

1. Set a dataset,
2. See how we prepare the data for training in PyText,
3. Get PyText,
4. Train it,
5. Visualise it,
6. Consider extensions,

Finally, we'll jump in to a fork of PyText where I've added a few features
that help out during training.

If you want to follow along, all the code for this post is available
[here]("").

#### The Dataset

I'm going to play around with my favourite dataset; [my
"scites"](https://scirate.com/noonsilk/scites) on
[SciRate](https://scirate.com) &mdash; i.e. those research papers that I'm
interested in.

We're going to frame this data as a recommendation problem:

<blockquote class="callout">Given some new research paper, will I be interested in it? And if so,
why?</blockquote>

This will be labelled data. Specifically, we will need two fields:
`title_and_abstract` (a blob of text which is the title of the paper and the
abstract concatenated together) and `scited` (a number, `1` if I "scited"
it, `0` if I didn't).

Here's an example, in Python:

``` python
title_and_abstract = """Generalized criteria of symmetry breaking. A strategy
for quantum time crystals. The aim of this paper is to propose a criterion
of spontaneous symmetry breaking that makes reference to the properties of
pure phases defined by a translationally invariant state. By avoiding
any reference to the ground state, at the basis of the standard
approach, this criterion applies to a wider class of models. An
interesting application is the breaking of time translations. Indeed, we
discuss explicit theoretical models which exhibit the prototypical
features of quantum time crystals, without the need of a time-dependent
Hamiltonian."""
scited = 0
arxiv_id = "1906.12293"
```

(Note: For reference, we'll also keep the arXiv id around, so we can
 cross-check more information, as we need it, by [visiting the
 link](https://scirate.com/arxiv/1906.12293))

##### The Dataset - Building it

Now, given that I manage the SciRate website, I have direct access to the
database. Here's the kind of dataset I'd like to build:

- 12,000 datapoints of papers that I've "scited",
- 12,000 datapoints of papers that I've opted _not_ to scite,

Then, from that set, I'm going to set aside 1.5k for "validation", and a
further 500 that, I promise you now, I will only use at the end of this
article, for the purposes of estimating how well the model is doing. In
pictures:

<img src="/images/blog/pytext-data-split.png" width="800" alt="Data split for
the recommendation problem." title="Data split for the recommendation
problem." />

Okay, so let's now make three csv's, `train.csv`, `validation.csv` and
`test.csv`. For right now we'll not look into how PyText wants the data
formatted; let's just assume that if we have these CSVs we can munge it into
the right format later.

Here's what I did:

<pre class="terminal">conda create -n pytext-scirate-recommendation python=3
source activate pytext-scirate-recommendation
pip install jupyter psycopg2
</pre>

Then, in the Jupyter notebook:

``` python


import psycopg2

my_user_id = 857
max_items  = 12_000

scited_query = f"""
select
    abstract,
    title,
    uid,
    1 as scited
from
    papers
inner join
    scites on
    scites.paper_uid = papers.uid
    and scites.user_id = {my_user_id}
where
    papers.submit_date > '01-Jan-2016'
order
    by random()
limit
    {max_items}
"""

not_scited_query = f"""
select
    abstract,
    title,
    uid,
    0 as scited
from
    papers
left outer join
    scites on
    scites.paper_uid = papers.uid
    and scites.user_id = {my_user_id}
where
    scites.id is null
    and
    papers.submit_date > '01-Jan-2016'
order
    by random()
limit
    {max_items}
"""

with psycopg2.connect("dbname=scirate") as connection:
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    cursor.execute(scited_query)
    scited = cursor.fetchall()

    cursor.execute(not_scited_query)
    not_scited = cursor.fetchall()

assert len(scited) == len(not_scited) == max_items

train = scited[:10_000]       + not_scited[:10_000]
val   = scited[10_000:11_500] + not_scited[10_000:11_500]
test  = scited[11_500:]       + not_scited[11_500:]

assert len(train) == 20_000
assert len(val)   ==  3_000
assert len(test)  ==  1_000

import pandas as pd

def write_csv (rows, name):
    df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=["abstract", "title", "arxiv_id", "scited"])
    df["abstract_and_title"] = (df["title"] + " " + df["abstract"])\
                                .replace("\t", " ")\
                                .replace("\r", " ")\
                                .replace("\n", " ")
    df = df.drop(columns=["abstract", "title"])
    
    df.to_csv(name + ".csv", index=False, header=False, sep="\t")


write_csv(train, "../data/train")
write_csv(val,   "../data/val")
write_csv(test,  "../data/test")
```

This is just a little hacked-together bit of code that grabs out papers that
I've definitely scited, and those for which I haven't scited. Note that it
limits it to those papers from the last 5 years, and also randomly orders
them. If we wanted to be a bit more precise, we could do the random ordering
according to a seed, but we're just in a blog post here, so we can be a bit
related :)

Note that this code requires the SciRate database, so you can't run it, but
here's the output: [noons scites -
download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16HIXwe_8MP2fXm_aqrHCdkLZzpjBFwMr/view?usp=sharing)
if you want to follow along with this exact dataset.



Great! Now I have my data in the `data` folder:

<pre class="terminal">
04:41 PM noon âˆˆ pytext-scirate-recommendation ls -alh data 
total 26M
drwxrwxr-x 4 noon noon 4.0K Jul  3 17:09 .
drwxrwxr-x 7 noon noon 4.0K Jul  2 08:26 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 noon noon 1.1M Jul  3 14:47 test.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 noon noon  22M Jul  3 14:47 train.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 noon noon 3.2M Jul  3 14:47 val.csv
</pre>

The sizes look good (i.e. val is smaller than train, and test is smaller
still, etc, so my script works!) Let's continue on.


#### Preparing the data for PyText

Okay, now that we have _some_ data, let's see what format PyText wants. Let's
head over to the [PyText
Documentation](https://pytext.readthedocs.io/en/master/).


##### ... turns out we have to first pick a model

Glancing at the [Train your first
model](https://pytext.readthedocs.io/en/master/train_your_first_model.html) we
can see that we need to build some kind of configuration object; and that in
particular we need to decide on a "task" and a "model". Specifically, we need
to build a JSON file like so:

``` JSON
{
  "version": 8,
  "task": {
    "DocumentClassificationTask": {
      "data": {
        "source": {
          "TSVDataSource": {
            "field_names": ["label", "slots", "text"],
            "train_filename": "pytext/tests/data/train_data_tiny.tsv",
            "test_filename": "pytext/tests/data/test_data_tiny.tsv",
            "eval_filename": "pytext/tests/data/test_data_tiny.tsv"
          }
        }
      },
      "model": {
        "DocModel": {
          "representation": {
            "DocNNRepresentation": {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So, let's think out our problem here as a "classification" problem.  We have
two independent classes, "scited" and "not scited". 

Now, glancing at the [PyText
classifiers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext#overview) that they
have set up by default, the one I want to use is this one: [Lin et al. (2017):
  A Structured Self-attentive Sentence Embedding
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03130). I'm picking this one because, firstly,
it's got this notion of _attention_. Scrolling through the paper, this is
the kind of output we can expect to get from this paper:

<center>
<img src="/images/blog/attention.jpg" width="900" title="Attention in the sentence embedding paper" alt="Attention in the sentence-embedding paper." />
</center>

Looks cool! It's certainly the idea we're going for &mdash; a kind of
"explanation" &mdash; the relevant words are highlighted (with a strength!) indicating why the decision (here, a 1-star review) was made.

Now, glancing at the documentation for the config file, our `"model"` section
will need to be like this:

``` JSON
{
  "model": {
    "representation": {
      "BiLSTMDocAttention": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Going back to the above config, we note that we don't have a "TSV"
(Tab-seperated values) we have a CSV, so we might need something like this:

``` JSON
{
  "DocumentClassificationTask": {
    "data": {
      "source": {
        "TSVDataSource": {
          "field_names":    ["arxiv_id", "label", "text"],
          "train_filename": "./data/train.csv",
          "test_filename":  "./data/test.csv",
          "eval_filename":  "./data/val.csv"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

(Note: the `field_names` needs to match the order in the CSV, and furthermore,
 hte fields "label" and "text" are used because they correspond to the names
 _in pytext code_, not because they are the names of the columns in our
 document. Further note: [there's a
 bug](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext/issues/747) where the
 TCV-parser doesn't respect quoted strings with the seperator in them.)

Okay. Ambitiously, let's just try putting everything together, and running it!
I'm going to call it `02-Jul-2019-Run-1.json` and it will have:

``` JSON
{
  "version": 8,
  "task": {
    "DocumentClassificationTask": {
      "data": {
        "source": {
          "TSVDataSource": {
            "field_names":    ["arxiv_id", "label", "text"],
            "train_filename": "./data/train.csv",
            "test_filename":  "./data/test.csv",
            "eval_filename":  "./data/val.csv"
          }
        }
      },
      "model": {
        "DocModel": {
          "representation": {
            "BiLSTMDocAttention": {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

(Note: It took me a few goes to get this config right; in the first instance
I even forgot to include the labels ("0" or "1") in the original CSV data!
But through the magic of blogging, it looks like I got it right the first
time!)

Firstly, I'll just install `pytext`! 

<pre class="terminal">
pip install pytext-nlp
</pre>

Then, I'll just run it according to the docs!

<pre class="terminal">
pytext train < config/02-Jul-2019-Run-1.json
</pre>

Now, I'm only running this on my laptop; no GPU, and after 3 epochs (~20
minutes) this is what pops out of the terminal:

<pre class="terminal">

</pre>

This says that this model got ~80% of the classifications right, and then has
a few more details. In any case, this is pretty great!

So, there's a few directions we can head in, now. Certainly it would be useful
to see the training runs in TensorBoard. It would also be great to be able to
run inference on a single title and abstract. We could also go into the weeds
and try and tweak the model, run it on a GPU, and other such things, to see
how far we can push the accuracy up.

Let's go for the TensorBoard/visualisation option, as it'll be a useful thing
to have, no matter which further steps we want to take.

#### Visualising the training

It's no coincidence that I'm choosing TensorBoard here, as this is something
that [PyText supports out of the
box](https://pytext.readthedocs.io/en/master/visualize_your_model.html). So
let's follow along. First, we install it:

<pre class="terminal">
pip install tensorboard
</pre>

Observe that there is a `runs` folder with some data in it:

<pre class="terminal">
(pytext-scirate-recommendation) 11:04 AM noon âˆˆ pytext-scirate-recommendation ls runs
Jul02_08-26-12_gpac  Jul02_08-31-57_gpac  Jul02_10-18-55_gpac  Jul02_10-33-37_gpac
</pre>

Then, we just run TensorBoard!

<pre class="terminal">
tensorboard --logdir runs
</pre>

(Note: I got a warning that I hadn't installed `tensorflow`, but it didn't
cause me any problems.)

Here's what I see:

<center>
<img src="/images/blog/tensorboard-pytext.png" width="900" title="TensorBoard graphs for our previous training run." alt="TensorBoard graphs for our previous training run." />
</center>

Of course, we didn't run for many epochs, so we don't see much improvement.
(Perhaps it's also worth noting that after just 1 epoch we were already at 70%
accuracy).

Now, this is all well-and-good, but we want something a bit more interesting.
At the top of this article, we were promised _attention_; i.e. that we could
see what words were contributing to the predictions. Wouldn't it be cool if we
could _see_ this in TensorBoard?! Yes, is the answer!

#### Building attention visualisation into TensorBoard

In order to do this, we're going to have to get funky with the pytext source
code (unfortunately, this isn't a feature that's supported out-of-the-box.)

This is our process:

1. Work out how to get attention out of the model,
2. Pick a few fixed samples that we run through the network during evaluation,
3. Somehow coax TensorBoard to display those samples with attention.

So, if you're happy to follow along, first, get yourself a copy of the pytext
codebase:

<pre class="terminal">
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext.git
</pre>

Now, because we're going to hack on this local version, instead of the version
we've installed, you'll want to uninstall the pytext we installed before, (from
within your conda environment), and then jump into your copy of the pytext repo,
and install _that_ in "develop" mode, so we can make code changes and have them
reflected:

<pre class="terminal">
pip uninstall pytext-nlp

# Jump to the folder where you cloned pytext
python setup.py develop
</pre>

Then, let's dive in.

#### 1. Getting attention out of the model

We recall we're using the `BiLSTMDocAttention` "representation" (remember,
this is what we specified in our JSON configuration file). Here,
"representation" is the same as an "embedding", namely, a way of
encoding a document as a vector. So, we know that the code
related to this thing, should match the description of the model in the
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03130.pdf). This will help us working
out which tensor is the attention, in the code.

Now, please note &mdash; I've looked into this before, way back when I was
playing with this repo around 8 months ago (in a previous job); [I opened an
issue at the time](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext/issues/143), and
it's still open. So, we'll attempt to use this blog post as an opportunity to
try and make a PR that fixes this problem.

As a result, I know that the first thing to look for is if the relevant parts
of the code do two things: 1) expose the appropriate attention tensor, so that
it can be used by us to evaluate the attention across the input and 2) [correctly 
implement the "hops" functionality from the
paper](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytext/issues/173), so that we get the full
power of the attention that the paper (supposedly!) provides.

We'll address the first item first, as it should be independent of the second.
We'll leave the second item for

##### So, how do we get the attention out, and display it?

Unfortunately, it turned out to be an involved process. I ended up spending
the better part of a day hacking around to make this work. It's all captured
in a branch which you can view here: [attention-hacking
branch](https://github.com/BraneShop/pytext/compare/master...BraneShop:attention-hacking). It's not super elegant, but it's enough to keep us going.

Here's the final config file I ended up using:

``` JSON
{
  "version": 8,
  "task": {
    "DocumentClassificationTask": {
      "trainer":  { "epochs": 20 },
      "data": {
        "source": {
          "TSVDataSource": {
            "field_names":    ["arxiv_id", "label", "text"],
            "train_filename": "./data/train.csv",
            "test_filename":  "./data/test.csv",
            "eval_filename":  "./data/val.csv"
          }
        }
      },
      "model": {
        "DocModel": {
          "decoder": { "has_attention": true },
          "representation": {
            "BiLSTMDocAttention": {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

(The main thing is that I added a new config option, `has_attention`, that
lets me introduce this extra functionality without (hopefully!) breaking
anything.)

I won't bore you with all the details (you can glance at the diff above to see
what I actually changed; it's not a lot), but the main highlights were:

<ul class="normal">
<li> Try not to break everything, </li>
<li> Pass the attention around so that it can be logged to TensorBoard, </li>
<li> Hack TensorBoard a bit and log an _image_ instead of text, so that highlighting can be displayed (See [this issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/1740#issuecomment-507766667) for why I had to do this.) </li>
</ul>

The final thing looks like so, in TensorBoard:

<center>
<img src="/images/blog/at_1.jpg" width="900" />
<br />
<img src="/images/blog/at_2.jpg" width="900" />
</center>

This has the important idea. Namely, the "important" words coloured in.
There's also the tokens (`__UNKNOWN__` and `__PAD__`) that PyText adds,
automatically, to deal with low-frequency words and the fact that we
need to feed in fixed-length sequences to get the benefits of fast
computation on the GPU.

In the next post (this took me so long I had to make it two parts!) we'll look
at the remaining items: Fixing the implementation to match the paper; working
out if the attention information it's providing is even sensible, consider
some extensions, and building a little "production-ready" interface!
