Last month we had our first AI for Leadership workshop. In this post we take a
look at what we covered, and discuss a few of the things we learned.

#### Who was there?

We had a variety of people from a mixed background of companies. We had a few
people from government, large global businesses, and local consulting groups,
and our new friends at [Adaptive Change Mindset](https://www.adaptivechangemindset.com).

Here's the breakdown of attendees according to preferred-pronouns:

<table class="stats" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
  <th>She/Her</th>
  <td>6</td>
</tr>
</tr>
  <th>He/Him</th>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="total">
  <th>Total attendees</th>
  <td>7</td>
</tr>
</table>

This follows in the tradition of our [6-Week techincal deep learning
workshop](/6-week-workshop-on-deep-learning.html), which was also majority
"She/Her" (at detailed analysis of that workshop is forthcoming; we have some
cool numbers to show!).

We are, of course, super excited with this. One of our big aims is to bring more
under-represented people into AI, and it's clear that we did that in this
workshop.


#### What did we do?

We started off with an overview of cutting-edge AI approaches, most of which
we've covered on the [Showreel](/showreel.html). We talked through these
applications and what the new developments are across different industries.

We then delved into what we mean when we talk about "AI", and how all the
various terms in this field: "Machine learning", "Deep learning", etc, fit
together.

The central idea, which you can read more about here: [AI For Leadership
Workshop](/ai-for-leadership.html), is to work through our adoption framework,
through group activities. In so doing, at each step we introduce the various
tricks of the trade we've learned through experience.

Our plan was to get people familiar with the thinking around AI adoption,
specifically:

- How do you come up with good ideas? What makes an AI idea good?
- How do you validate an idea? What do you need?
- What should you build in a "Proof of Concept" (PoC)? What should you test? How do you know if it fails?
- Who needs to be involved when embedding it in the business?
- And, crucially, how do we structure the system for continuous improvement?


#### What can you expect in November?

For our next leadership workshop, coming up in
[November](https://events.humanitix.com.au/braneshop-ai-for-leadership-november),
we expect to follow a similar process, but with the following changes, based
on some feedback from some of the attendees:

- We're going to go into a bit more depth on some pre-existing case studies,
  in terms of understanding how other companies have successfully built AI
  projects,
- Establish more of the data-science side of the projects for the group
  activities, so people can focus on the leadership decisions,
- Allocate more time to some of the exercises, so each group has time to focus
  on all the aspects of the task.


#### Overall

Our aim with this workshop is to have you walk away feeling confident about
your ability to implement AI projects in your business. We want you to
understand the risks, and the process, as well as the right questions to ask
to evaluate proposed solutions, and rough milestones you should look for.

If you'd like to join us in November, you can [grab tickets
