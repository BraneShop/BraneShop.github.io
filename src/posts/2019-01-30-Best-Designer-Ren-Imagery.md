title: Thanks to Ren Imagery for our new logo!

We have a new logo! You can see it loud and proud at the top of every page;
but here is it again:

<center><img style='background: black; padding: 20px;' src="/images/braneshop-blue.png" width="400" /></center>

I like it in particular because it kind of conveys "brain-ness" with the wavey
lines; which perhaps remind you of your own brain. It also feels a bit "80s"
and "fun" to me; a style that [I'm well-known to
love](https://silky.github.io/posts/2019-01-27-Designing-Functional-Cloths-with-Haskell.html), and, of course, it's amenable to funky bright colours.

In my opinion
[Ren](https://www.theloop.com.au/renlemon/portfolio/Graphic-Designer/Melbourne)
is one of the best designers going around (disclaimer: she's a friend of
mine), and I wanted to give some reasons why:

<ul class="normal">
<li> **Collaborative**: Ren chatted to me frequently; asked my opinion about what I want, and submitted some designs to me for review and to guide further design.  </li>
<li> **Diverse options**: Unlike other designs I've seen in the past, each of Ren's designs was actually quite different. And not just a slightly different colour of a dot, or lower case over upper case; each design I was presented had it's own strong elements, story, and justifcation.  I think this is a very important skill for design, that I've not seen many people be able to do, and Ren does it amazingly well.
</li>
<li> **Comprehensive**: Once I picked a design I liked, Ren gave me the logo
in many formats and colours, and also included the little "elements" (such as
the squiggle in the bottom-left of the logo) as seperate things to include and
use through-out the website. For anyone looking to get up and running with
their new design, this is invaluable.
</li>
<li> **Consistency**: Ren has done design work for me in the past, and it has
been consistently excellent. The previous work was for
[Compose Conference](http://www.composeconference.org/), and the resulting
logo was designed collaboratively between Ren, Lyndon and Myself, and I have to say that
it's now iconic in the functional-programming community as the "Lambda-Tram":

</li>
</ul>

So, if you're looking for any kind of design work, definitely get in contact
with her over at [Ren
Imagery](https://www.theloop.com.au/renlemon/portfolio/Graphic-Designer/Melbourne) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-harris-22409899/)!
