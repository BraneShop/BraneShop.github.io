Earlier this week Ruth and I were on RRR's [Byte Into
It](https://www.rrr.org.au/explore/programs/byte-into-it/episodes/8310-byte-into-it-10-july-2019)
talking about our workshops, and our approach to enriching the AI community in
general (click the link if you want to have a listen to the show).

I wanted to discuss a bit our intention with our scholarships, and our vision
for the AI community.


#### The Braneshop Community

We love community here at the Braneshop. In fact, in an amazing coincidence,
we've actually moved in to a space _called_ [Our Community
House](https://ochouse.com.au), out in North Melbourne.

One thing we want to do is help people feel at home in the AI community.
