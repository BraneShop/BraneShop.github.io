</ul>

As the year draws to a close, and Braneshop is almost a year old (woo!) we
have been thinking a lot about our business goals. As such, I (Noon) have been
having some discussions with different people and businesses about how
Braneshop could align and/or collaborate with their businesses, naturally this
has lead into a lot of conversations about where Braneshop is "heading".


The question is this: What kind of business is Braneshop? How do I see it
changing over the years? What are our aims? 

After thinking about it for a while, I think it's nicely captured by the idea
of what I'm going to call "A Living Business". 

What does that mean?! In the following blog two blog posts, I’ll talk about what
inspired it and what it means to us. We welcome you to reach beyond the usual
business comfort-zone and  read on!

First up, in this post, we'll explore the inspirations. I start by introducing
them and then end with what we define as "A Living Business".  (If you want to

#### First Inspiration: Christopher Alexander

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/nature-of-order.jpg" width="300px" /></center>

One of my favourite discoveries of recent years has been the work of
[Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander)
and colleagues.

Introduced to me by my good friend Reuben, I started with [The Timeless Way of
Building](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106728.The_Timeless_Way_of_Building).
Some of my new favourites are [The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)
and, as we shall see, [The Nature of
Order](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3131171-the-nature-of-order).

One of the big focus points for this work is:  What makes something feel
"alive"? We know it when we walk into a space and it just makes us _feel_
good. How can we quantify that idea? How can we construct it? He goes into
significant detail in the Nature of Order series.

His exploration lies predominantly within the field of architecture and urban
planning,  but we believe this exploration can extented further. So, we have
been attempting to explore some of the elements he sets out but in the context
of a business, in particular in the context of Braneshop.

Here are some of the elements brought up, and my interpretation of them within
Braneshop.

<table class="blog-split" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Architecture/Urban Planning</th>
<th>Braneshop/Business</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>How well does this building interact with its environment?</td>
<td>How well does the Braneshop integrate into the local business
landscape?</td></tr>
<tr><td>How should it be constructed? Entirely pre-planned? Adapted to it's
environment? Who was involved in the construction? The people that will live
there?
</td>
<td>
What kind of planning should be involved in the business, and who should be
involved?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
How do things change over time? Should a building ever be "finished"?
</td>
<td>
Should there be an end-point? An ultimate goal?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
How were problems discovered and addressed?
</td>
<td>
How do we decide which parts of the business are going well, and which parts
are going badly?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Where should attention be focused when it comes time to make changes?
</td>
<td>
What should be our focus and over what time period?
</td></tr>
</table>

Taken together, this offers a different way of coming up and acting on a
business plan. It also allows us to think about how we're going to integrate
into the existing community, and prompts us to think about the impact the
business has on ourselves, and others around it.


#### Inspiration #2: Mindfulness

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/buddhism.png" width="300px" /></center>

I have been really enjoying reading books on Buddhism and mindfulness, and
specifically, books that talk about the “scientific” adoption of certain
mindfulness ideas.

Perhaps one of the
best examples of this is 
[Why Buddhism Is
True](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32895535-why-buddhism-is-true)
(a nice/funny [talk by the Author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJZTrVlSBTY)),
a book that was recommended to me by my friend Julia.

The focus of this book is to on how scientific ideas in modern psychology are
related to ideas in Buddhism, which at first might seem mystical.  Although
the title is provocative, the book itself is very reasonable and well worth a
read.

<table class="blog-split" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Mindfulness/Buddhism</th>
<th>Braneshop/Business</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Focus on "awareness".<br />
Ability and intention to focus on "the present".
</td>
<td>
How does "the present" relate to business planning?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Empathy for ourselves and others.
</td>
<td>
Are we aware of how we're impacting the community?<br />
What can we do to build empathy?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Desire not to cause harm and suffering to ourselves and others.
</td>
<td>
How do we improve things in our community?
</td></tr>
</table>

Overall, it's clear that while some forms of business are outright harmful,
there are certainly many businesses aiming to do good in their community (many
of whom are housed at [OC House](https://ochouse.com.au)!)

I think one of the more interesting avenues of thought around being aware of
the present &mdash; "living in the present" &mdash; and how it relates to
every day and long-term business activities.


#### Final Inspiration: The Value of Everything

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/mariana.png" width="300px" /></center>

I first heard of [Mariana
Mazzucato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Mazzucato) when I saw her
speaking in a panel at the Wheeler Centre. She was there to talk about her
book [The Value of
Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502362-the-value-of-everything)
and discuss ideas around economic growth that is innovative, inclusive and
sustainable, as well as the role of government and the public sector in
creating "value" in the economy.


The book is a really inspiring discussion of economics, a history on
how society decides what work is considered "valuable", and a discussion on
what level of involvement the government should have in innovation.


One topic that stood out is the idea of "Shareholders", people who hold a
percentage of your company, versus "Stakeholders", people whom your
company impacts, financially or otherwise.

She raises the observation that maximising "shareholder" value is not the only
thing a business can do. A business exists within an ecosystem; within the
environment, and impacts people and it's ecosystem. She suggested that
measuring this impact is not accounted for by current business practices.

This simple, yet powerful, idea has captured the attention of people in
industry, from [B-Corps](https://bcorporation.com.au/) to community 
organisations and social enterprises.
 
As before, we have been taking in Mazzucato's ideas and considering what they
mean in the context of Braneshop. 

<table class="blog-split" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>The Value of Everything</th>
<th>Braneshop/Business</th></tr>
<tr><td>
What activities create "value"?
</td>
<td>
What are we trying to improve?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
How does valuable work and other activities relate to GDP?<br />
Is GDP a good measure of an economy?
</td>
<td>
How do we measure and think about our impact?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Stakeholders vs. Shareholders.<br />
Maximising shareholder value, or something else?
</td>
<td>
Who do we impact?<br />
Should we be going for maximum profit, or something else?
</td></tr>
</table>

This prompts ideas of metrics and measurements. What should we count? Who
should we count for? What kind of growth matters, and how do we quantify it?


### So ...

We are using our inspiration to consider the ecosystem that is Braneshop, as a
business.

<center><img src="/images/blog/living-business/braneshop-inspo.png" width="100%" /></center>

What are we about? What are our goals? How big do we want to be, or do we
want to stay small? What swork should we go for, or what work should we pass
on? Where do we want to be in 5 or 10 years?

And, ultimately:

**How will these ideas and values help us make decisions day-to-day?**
