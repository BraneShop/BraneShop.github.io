At Braneshop we're keen to see AI develop positively in our community. The
rules and regulation around AI will play a key role in ensuring that the AI
that is ultimately built and used ends up creating good community outcomes.

The Australian Human Rights Commission recently put out a [call for
consultation on AI - Governance and
Leadership](https://tech.humanrights.gov.au/consultation). The deadline for
a submission is the 18th of March at 5pm (so there's still time if you're
quick!)

Working with Martin and Sam at [Northraine](https://www.northraine.com/) and
other interested parties, we prepared a joint submission, which you
can read here: [Our HRC Submission](/files/HRC_Submission.pdf).

One really important message regarding ethics and AI, that I've seen recently,
comes from the following papers: [The Ethics of AI Ethics -- An Evaluation of
Guidelines](https://scirate.com/arxiv/1903.03425).

Quoting the author:

> "Ethics is then no longer understood as a deontologically inspired tick-box
> exercise, but as a project of advancing personalities, changing attitudes,
> strengthen responsibilities and gaining courage to refrain from certain
> actions, which are deemed unethical. [...] **It should not be the objective
> of ethics to stifle activity, but to do the exact opposite**, i.e.
> broadening the scope of action, uncovering blind spots, promoting autonomy
> and freedom, and fostering self-responsibility." - <small>Thilo Hagendorff</small>

Emphasis mine.

This is a crucial and important thought when considereding any kind of "normative",
rule-based, punishment-driven acitivies, over those that enrich, embolden and
allow for, and encourage, the growth of people and communities.
