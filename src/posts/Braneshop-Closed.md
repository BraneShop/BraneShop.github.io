Well! It's with some sadness that I officially announce a _Branefreeze_[^1]:
Braneshop is closing down, for now.

In no small part it's due to covid: Like everyone, we've found it hard to do
business in this time; and in particular in the high-tech skills education
space &mdash; peoples focus now is on their health, mental health and ability
to function in their job and life. Paying for an online course to learn new
skills is a big ask, and something that I don't feel comfortable (or able!) to
continue to pursue at this point.

For those who are currently on or have previously completed our online
workshop; your content will remain online idefinitely, at this point.

I'll also leave the [blog](/blog.html) posts and showreel online; but I won't continue to update
anything.


#### Our focus on diversity

I'm pleased to say that I believe our focus on diversity has gone pretty well.
We had an explicit agenda to get more diverse people into the AI field; in
particular those people who self-identified as facing specific barriers.

This approach: self-identification of barriers came about during discussions
with Lana Woolf from [Edge Effect](https://www.edgeeffect.org/) whose guidance
was, roughly, in order to support diverse groups of people, you shouldn't
pre-suppose what issues they've faced, or pre-categorise them. By letting
people express their own experiences, you can understand more about what they
need, and hence support them. This is especially important in her environment
where things change quite a lot, but also in ours, where over time we expect
different experiences and backgrounds to be excluded or included; and we want
to capture that dynamically.

In terms of statistics, of all the people we trained, people who identified as
he/him were less than half^[This isn't a perfect measure of diversity, but
it's the best I came up with based on the data we captured. Very happy to hear thoughts about better ways to
quantify this!]. We also gave away ~AUD$10,000 in scholarships. I'm
very proud of this, and I hope others in the industry can take up a similar
practice.


#### Thanks!

Of course I owe thanks to many people. Naturally, without
[Gala](http://galacamacho.com/) it would've been impossible for me to launch
this business. She's supported me in many ways; not least financially,
personally, professionally, pedagogically and technically.

Secondly, the people I've worked with,
[Esmeralda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blancaesmeralda/) and
[Ruth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruth-pearson-35560488/)! I'm so glad
you've both found new and better jobs, and I'm so glad to have worked with
you. In particular I really learned a lot working with Esmeralda and forming
and working through the "[Living Business](/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-1.html)" ideas together, and
with Ruth I enjoyed teaching the workshops together and wouldn't've got the
first workshop going without your help :)

I'm also going to thank my Mum for helping with book-keeping and just
generally believing in me to do whatever I wanted to do :)

Thanks also to everyone else who has been very supportive to us over the
years. I'm sure I've told you I appreciate it :)

Finally, thanks of course to all the students who've come along and attended
our courses! I'm sure you know we've had a lot of fun working with you, and we
hope you got something out of your experience :)

Thanks :)

#### For me

For me personally, I'm moving on to another very exciting job (and actually
I'm incredibly privileged to have gotten <i>any</i> job in this time!), so
feel free to connect or catch up with [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noonsilk/),
or just send me an [email](mailto:noonsilk@gmail.com), if you're interested in staying in contact :)


[^1]: Thanks to [Chuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuan-lim-86581615) for
this pun. I wasn't sure if I should use this one, or the more involved joke
I had thought of: "Braneshop manifold proven topologically closed". Feel free
to enjoy whichever one you would've preferred (or both!).
