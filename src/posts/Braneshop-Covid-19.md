Hope you're all staying safe out there in light of all the COVID-19 news. Our
favourite place for information is [The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/au) and
[health.gov.au](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert).

As you're probably aware, our workshops are typically run in person,
in (small) groups.

In light of COVID-19, and the fact that a lot of people are self-isolating,
we've decided to put all our in-person workshops on hold until the
health.gov.au advice is that it's safe to gather in large groups again, or
otherwise until the community feels safe and comfortable with small in-person
events.

In the mean time, we're keen to try out some different ways of engaging
online, so stay tuned for what they may look like. We're open to ideas for
what you might like to see, so please send in your suggestions.

Finally, an  alternative revenue stream for us is consulting, so [reach
out](/contact.html) if you have anything, related to computer-vision, NLP,
data engineering, AI strategy or otherwise AI-related that we can help you with!

Thanks, and take care!
