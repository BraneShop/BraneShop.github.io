Hope you're all staying safe out there in light of all the COVID-19 news. My
favourite place for information is [The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/au) and
[health.gov.au](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert).

As you're probably aware, almost all our activities as Braneshop are in
person, in groups.

As such, we have to put everything on hold until the situation with COVID-19
closes out, and it's safe to gather again.

Take care, and reach out if you have any questions/comments.
