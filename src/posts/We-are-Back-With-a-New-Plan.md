Hope you're all doing well.

I've been thinking a bit about how Braneshop can continue down the workshop
path, in some online capacity.

After chatting to lots of different people about how to manage this new
environment, one particular conversation with my friend
[Eike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eike-zeller-1464b767/) really inspired me
to come up with a plan that I actually like, and I think respects the
intention and goals of Braneshop.

Eike challenged me to come up with some idea that would work particularly well
in this new environment. So here's the resulting idea.

#### Central idea: Individual, self-paced, supported by weekly 1-on-1s

<div class="features">
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/week-by-week.png" alt="Content release week-by-week." />
  <p>Content will be released to you week-by-week.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/your-pace.png" alt="Set at your own pace." />
  <p>Read the content and exercises at your own pace.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/1-on-1.png" alt="1-on-1 chats to support learning"/>
  <p>One-on-one video-chat sessions with an instructor each week.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/exercises.png" alt="Complete exercises and homework to build knowledge."/>
  <p>Complete exercises and homework to consolidate your knowledge.
  </p>
  </div>
</div>

One of the things I have observed is in common among different online course
offerings, is that the companies are focused on throughput &mdash; as such, video
lectures and automated assessments seem to be the norm. While this might work
for some people, there are many of us for which that does not work well. 

As a result, we have developed a plan for the [technical
workshop](/technical-deep-learning-workshop.html), which flips things around:
we'll let people read the content and attempt exercises at their own pace, and
have weekly check-ins with an instructor for an hour long 1-on-1 chat. 

We see lots of positives to this approach:

<ul class="normal">
<li>Individualised and targeted learning is a way we stand out. We can expose
different content for different people, making the learning bespoke, and build
in space for focused and useful support.</li>
<li>Anyone can join at any time; there should be less scheduling conflicts and
flexibility for different needs.</li>
<li>The self-paced style, with regular check-ins, means people don't get lost
mid-way through the course, and allows for the flexibility for them to always
feel supported.</li>
<li>The format scales in a way that we like &amp; across individuals and up to
our capacity to interact meaningfully. [This stays true to our our style.](/tags/living-business.html)</li>
<li>The self-paced style, but _with check-ins_, means people don't get lost
mid-way through the course, and means they always feel supported.</li>
</ul>

In order to join this course, we'll first have a (free) 1-on-1 video chat, to
get a feeling for where you are at currently, and where you want to go. We'll
chat over the course, how it'll be structured, and then start from where you
are.

We've reduced the price, given that the format is changing, but we're keeping
the [scholarship](/technical-deep-learning-workshop.html#scholarship), as our
focus to increase the diversity and representation
within the AI community has not changed.

You can read more about this [over on the technical deep learning
workshop](/technical-deep-learning-workshop.html) page.



#### On the Leadership workshop ...

We have decided to put the leadership workshop on hold, for now.
The format works best as a group, and as a focused day. We are still thinking
about how we can make that work online; if you haves, email us!

We have, instead, extended our offering to include [advisory and consulting
work, which we've detailed here](/advisory-and-consulting.html).
Our aim is to continue work with companies in a strategic and targeted way,
and to support leaders to make the best of AI.

We are really excited for this new offering and are looking forward to
working with organisations in this capacity!


#### Trial of the Online Technical Deep Learning Workshop

Given that this is a new idea for us, and that there will be a few kinks to
work out, we'd like to open this up, firstly, for 3 people **for free**. After
working with this "trial group" for 3 weeks, we'll open up to the general
public.

If you'd like to participate in this trial group, then please register your
interest.

<div class="btn-b">
<a class="btn" title="Register for the Braneshop Technical Workshop Trial"
href="https://noon006807.typeform.com/to/J2BFQY">Register for the Technical Workshop Trial</a>
</div>

We'll kick things off in the last week of April.


#### Overall

We're trying to work out how to stay viable as a business in this new
environment, as well as offering some services that actually help people and
offer something valuable. We think this is a good idea, but it needs to work
for _you_ as well.

As always, I'm really interested in your feedback and thoughts. So please
reach out if you have any. Does this format work for you? Is it missing
something you'd like to see?  Let us know!

Thanks!
