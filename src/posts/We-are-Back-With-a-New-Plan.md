Hope you're all doing well.

I've been thinking a bit about how Braneshop can continue down the workshop
path, in some online capacity.

After chatting to lots of different people about how to manage this new
environment, one particular conversation with my friend
[Eike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eike-zeller-1464b767/) really inspired me
to come up with a plan that I actually like, and I think respects the
intention and goals of Braneshop.

Eike challenged me to come up with some idea that would work particularly well
in this new environment. So here's the resulting idea.

#### Central idea: Individual, self-paced, supported by weekly 1-on-1s

<div class="features">
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/week-by-week.png" alt="Content release week-by-week." />
  <p>Content will be released to you week-by-week.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/your-pace.png" alt="Set at your own pace." />
  <p>Read the content and exercises at your own pace.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/1-on-1.png" alt="1-on-1 chats to support learning"/>
  <p>One-on-one video-chat sessions with an instructor each week.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
  <img src="/images/exercises.png" alt="Complete exercises and homework to build knowledge."/>
  <p>Complete exercises and homework to consolidate your knowledge.
  </p>
  </div>
</div>

Focusing on the [technical workshop](/technical-deep-learning-workshop.html),
the main thing I've noticed in other online courses is that they are focused
on the quantity of people through; with video lectures and automated assessment.
This might work well for some people, but there's definitely a group for whom
it doesn't work well. I'm one of those people.

As a result, the plan that I've come up with is to flip things around; we'll
let people read the content and attempt the exercises **at their own pace**,
but we will have **weekly check-ins** with an instructor, for an hour long
1-on-1 chat.

I like this idea for several reasons:

- Individualised and targeted learning is a way we stand out. This allows us
to continue to do that really well. We can expose different content for different
people, and really focus in our help.
- It means anyone can join at any time; there should be less scheduling
conflicts with us running the workshop on a specific date.
- The format can't "scale" well, but that's okay, because we really want to
just focus on individuals, rather than large groups.
- The self-paced style, but _with check-ins_, means people don't get lost
mid-way through the course, and means they always feel supported.

In order to join this course, we'll first have a (free) 1-on-1 video chat, to
get a feeling for where you are at currently, and where you want to go. We'll
chat over the course and how it'll be structured, and then take it from there.

We've reduced the price, given that the format is changing, but we're keeping
the [scholarship](/technical-deep-learning-workshop.html#scholarship), as we
haven't changed our thinking about increasing the diversity and representation
within the AI community.

You can read more about this format [over on the technical deep learning
workshop](/technical-deep-learning-workshop.html) page.



#### On the Leadership workshop ...

For the leadership workshop, we've decided to leave that one on hold, for now.
The format there works best as a group, where everyone can be completely
focused for a day. I think it'd be pushing it to make that work online, at
this point; or at least I can't see how.

We have, however, extended our offering to include [advisory and consulting
work, which we've detailed on this new page](/advisory-and-consulting.html).
Our aim is to still work with companies in a strategic way, but, again, in a
more targeted way.


#### Trial of the Online Technical Deep Learning Workshop

Given that this is a new idea for us, and that there will be a few kinks to
work out, we'd like to open this up, firstly, for 3 people **for free**. After
working with this "trial group" for 3 weeks, we'll open up to the general
public.

If you'd like to participate in this trial group, then please register your
interest.

<div class="btn-b">
<a class="btn" title="Register for the Braneshop Technical Workshop Trial"
href="https://noon006807.typeform.com/to/J2BFQY">Register for the Technical Workshop Trial</a>
</div>

We'll kick things off in the last week of April.


#### Overall

We're trying to work out how to stay viable as a business in this new
environment, as well as offering some services that actually help people and
offer something valuable. We think this is a good idea, but it needs to work
for _you_ as well.

As always, I'm really interested in your feedback and thoughts. So please
reach out if you have any. Does this format work for you? Is it missing
something you'd like to see?  Let us know!

Thanks!
