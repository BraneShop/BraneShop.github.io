We love staying up to date with the latest deep learning research. I typically
catch up daily, via the [SciRate](https://scirate.com) website (check if out
if you haven't already!)

Every now and then, a paper really stands out as either cool, interesting,
innovative, or useful. When something really appealed to me, I'd typically
post it in various places, such as LinkedIn, or slack, or twitter, or just
file it away in my head, waiting for the perfect moment to pop up again.

We also typically include these as part of the workshops, to get people a bit
excited about the field.

Well, now I've decided to put that list online: <a href="/showreel.html">Deep
learning showreel!</a>

<!--more-->

Each paper comes with an indicative picture, and a little blurb explaining why
it's interesting/important or what we like about it. Feel free to take a
browse only at those pictures that interest you. You can also browse by tag;
for example here's the items for
[computer-vision](showreel-tags/computer-vision.html) (you can see all the
tags at the bottom of that page).

This list will also go out in our monthly newsletter, so if you're interested
in such things, then subscribe below!

If you're technical, and want to get the items before they hit the page, I've
[set up a bit of a system on
github](https://github.com/BraneShop/showreel) that lets me collect
the interesting papers there, for later processing.

We hope you find this useful!
