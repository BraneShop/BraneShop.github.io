This year, we've been thinking about our prior workshops: what worked well,
what what should change, and what we'd like to focus on this year.

A few ideas have emerged.

#### [Technical Workshop](/technical-deep-learning-workshop.html) <small>(on the 10th of April)</small>

**#1 Smaller classes**

The idea is twofold. For our first workshop, we had 17 people and two
instructors. We had people work in groups. I think this is a nice idea, but we
found that the skill-level of people was quite varied, and teaming people up
didn't necessarly mean that they worked together well as a group, in terms of
bringing everyone up to the same rough skill level.

We think that if we limit the number of attendees, say to six people per
session, then we can _still_ have two groups, but give closer attention
and support to everyone. And furthermore, the skill variance should be
smaller, so it will be easier to manage.

Furthermore, and importantly, _we can also change the workshop content_ to
suit the interests of the participants.

While we were able to do this a bit in the larger workshop, I'm sure that
there are things we could've covered.

**#2 New schedule**

From chatting to a few people, I've learned that it's probably inconvenient to
do the workshop over _6 weeks_, where most of the time commitment is actually
outside (typical) work hours.

So, we've decided to drop the workshop down to two eight-hour days, _followed by_ an
afternoon post-workshop session. The eight hour days roughly cover the original
content, and the final afternoon is intended as a kind of project kick-off
session. The idea is that either you bring something you want to work on,
and we get started together; or you work through one of our projects that
we've thought of; that explores a particular aspect of deep learning.

We've also put the workshop so that it has a weekend during the middle of the
two days.


#### [AI For Leadership Workshop](/ai-for-leadership.html) <small>(on the 23rd of March)</small>


We've run a few of these now, and overall they're going well. The one-day
format works really nicely, and having a group of about 10 people allows for
really interesting exchanges and interactions, as well as good group
activities.

We won't really be changing a lot, but there are some thoughts floating around
of other areas to cover:

- Platforms/Hardware:  Should we build or buy? What are the pros/cons?
- Tools: What's good? How should we adopt it?
- Case studies: What are other companies doing out there?

We already cover a few case studies, but we'll try and add in a few more.

I also want to allow this workshop to develop along the interests of the
attendees, so perhaps we'll find a way to work in a bit of the themes of the
afternoon session from the tech workshop into this format. I.e. a "BYO
Problem" discussion section.


#### Overall

In general, we're keen to learn and adapt to what works, and what helps us
build a sustainable business.

We're always interested in hearing from you, in any capacity, about what is of
interest, what would suit you best, and what kinds of formats works well.

Overall, our aim remains the same:

- Bring more people into the AI industry,
- Support people with their AI projects,
- Push the AI field in a much ethical/sustainable direction,
- Engage with people and projects we love, that are doing good out in the
world!

If you have any thoughts, [please send them our way!](/contact.html).

In particular, if you'd like to join a workshop, but have some specific needs
that we're not meeting, or concerns that are holding you back, please reach
out! We'll do our best to help.
