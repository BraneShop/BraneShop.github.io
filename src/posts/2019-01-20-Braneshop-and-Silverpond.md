title: Braneshop, Silverpond, and the Deep Learning Workshop
author: Noon van der Silk

For the past 2 and a half years, as part of
[Silverpond](https://silverpond.com.au) I (and others there) have been
successfully delivering the deep learning workshop. It all started way back in September 2016,
[Lyndon](http://sordina.github.io/) and I posted about it on the
[ML/AI Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-AI-Meetup/events/233901076/).
The Braneshop has now partnered with Silverpond to deliver the workshops, and
we are so excited!


#### The workshop has come a long way

The first time we ran it, we had everyone packed into the meeting room at
Silverpond, and for four hours we talked through the fundamentals of deep
learning.  Everytime we have ran it we asked for feedback, and as such,
each iteration has been improved, tweaked, and been added to. It has been
our aim that the workshop stays current, relevant, and useful. The deep
learning workshop has gone from a four-hour "intensive", to a one day
training, to a two-day workshop 9to include a project day), and now, it has
evolved into a three-day learn-practice-apply kind of workshop.


#### We have had an impact far and wide

In only two years, we have trained almost 150 people. We've seen attendance
from a wide variety of backgrounds and careers: management, data science,
programmers, government, Big-4 consulting, specialised hardware startups,
computer gaming, as well as not-for-profits and artists.

These workshops have helped people and organisations acquire the knowledge
needed to bring AI into their projects. Having started in 2016, they have made
their mark in the burgeoning AI community in Melbourne.


#### The future of the workshops: The Braneshop

We are excited to continue teaching cutting edge technology in a hands-on and
intuitive manner, and so, we've moved on to running the workshops as an
independent company, where we can focus on delivery, pedagogy, content
development, and up-skilling under-represented groups. Silverpond is our 
[partner](https://silverpond.com.au/2019/01/18/partnering-with-braneshop-for-silverponds-workshops/)
on this journey, and I'm personally grateful for their support (in particular
Jono and Lyndon) and am looking forward to the future!

#### Here are a few ways you can get involved

<ul class="normal">
<li>Does your organisation need an injection of Deep Learning? [Get in touch](/contact.html)!</li>
<li>Do you want to upskill --- learn the foundations of Deep Learning, get
comfortable with TensorFlow, and learn how to train and deploy your models?
Come to the [workshop](/deep-learning-workshop.html) (25th, 26th of
March, 2019!</li>
<li>Do you have a specific set of topics or an idea --- in AI and
it's implementation --- that you think we could teach at your
organisation? [Get in touch](/contact.html)! (We also have an "AI for
  Leadership" workshop in the making; let us know if that's of interest!)
