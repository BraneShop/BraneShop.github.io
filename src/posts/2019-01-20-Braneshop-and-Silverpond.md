title: Braneshop, Silverpond, and the Deep Learning Workshop

For the past 2 and a half years, as part of [Silverpond](https://silverpond.com.au) we've been
delivering the deep learning workshop. Way back in September 2016,
[Lyndon](http://sordina.github.io/) and I posted about it on the
[ML/AI Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-AI-Meetup/events/233901076/).

We had everyone packed into the meeting room at Silverpond, and for four hours
we chatted through the fundamentals of deep learning. We received heaps of
feedback (positive and critical feedback) from people, and decided to give it
a proper go as a full-day workshop later that year.

Since that time, through Silverpond, we trained almost 150 people, and the
workshop progressed from a 1-day theory and exercises session, to a 2-day
theory, exercises, and group projects. We've seen attendance from a wide
variety of people: managers, data scientists, government, big 4 consulting,
and specialised hardware and software, as well as not-for-profits.

You can see a few of the photos from the events over the years below (and also
on the [deep learning workshop page](/deep-learning-workshop.html)):

Now, we've moved on to running the workshops as an independent company, where
we can focus on delivery and content development. Silverpond is our
[partner](https://silverpond.com.au/2019/01/18/partnering-with-braneshop-for-silverponds-workshops/)
on this journey, and I'm personally grateful for their support and excited for
the future!
