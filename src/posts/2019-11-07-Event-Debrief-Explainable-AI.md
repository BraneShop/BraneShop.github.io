Last night we held a discussion group, here at [OC
House](https://ochouse.com.au/) around Explainable AI. Here's an overview of
what we covered:


<!--more-->

- What is an explanation? What kinds of questions would we like to ask a model?
- What is happening out in the research world? What are the different approaches?
- What are the alternatives to trying to "explain" deep models?
- What are some of the tools, and how can I use them?
- What does it even _mean_ to "know" things?
- What are people out in industry using explainable AI for? (Answer: It's not
    for end-users to understand models.)

Here are the slides:
