#### Fires

It's been a terrible start of the year for Australia. I've been following the
news over on [The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jan/08/nsw-fires-live-updates-victoria-bushfires-south-australia-fire-sa-australian-bushfire-near-me-rfs-cfa-latest-news-wednesday).

**As a result, we've decided to donate 50% of our profits** (i.e. just less the
venue costs and teaching time), from our two workshops in Feb. Hopefully this
will be a few thousand dollars.

If you want to do more, my friend Milly noted in a nice
[thread](https://twitter.com/meelijane/status/1213251935035260928) you can
also remove your money from banks and superannuation firms that fund fossil
fuel. [Bank Australia](https://www.bankaust.com.au/responsible-banking/) has
been my choice.  Finally, Gala and I have also gone through our house and
found a bunch of things to give away.

#### Workshops

We've got _two_ workshops in Feb! We're running the 6 Week Technical Deep
Learning Workshop for the second time. It starts on the 6th of Feb. And we're
(in the middle of that workshop!) doing the leadership workshop for the 3rd
time, on the 17th. Details below.

#### New Computer!

<center><img src="/images/blog/mona.png" style="width: 500px" /></center>

This is the face that greets you when you log in to our new GPU training
machine, `eltahawy`. It is, of course, [Mona
Eltahawy](https://twitter.com/monaeltahawy), feminist giant and
[author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Eltahawy#Bibliography).

The computer is this one from
[ScorpTec](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/Ready-to-Run-PCs/Gaming-PC/77756-SS-TEMPEST2080TI-2). 
It cost $4,900. A solid expense, but it's already proven very useful for doing ML experiments.

The main thing I wanted was space for GPUs. I picked this computer because it
had a good starting setup; a pretty powerful GPU (11GB RAM) + lots of fans. I
learned that it's good to pick a GPU with more cooling, as it means it can run
faster. Fine. The next biggest card I found, the [24GB
Titan](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/Graphics-Cards/NVIDIA/76038-900-1G150-2500-000)
was $4300 alone. While it _is_ better to have more GB in one card, I don't
have the requirement for this right at the minute.

I chose a local computer over a cloud one for "ease of experimentation".
Namely, while I love [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for
the workshop; it's hard to run experiments over several days. It also means I
can horde datasets; which is great! And, furthermore, it let's me keep _all_
my training/experiment checkpoints, which is particularly useful for artistic
experimentation, but also useful for training provenance/etc.

In any case, if you're looking for a GPU machine, ScorpTec is a great place to
go! Because I bought off-the-shelf, I ordered the machine at 7.30am and it was
ready to pick up at 9.30am that same day! So cool.
