### Idea: The Living Business<a name="living-business"></a>

1. **Presence**

From mindfulness, we recognise that the present moment is valuable. It's where
we live and work. It's important to enjoy and value this moment.

For Braneshop that means acknowledging the present work. Enjoying the current
workshop, the current group of people weâ€™re working with, the current
projects, the current activity.

We aim to have a present-mindset over a grow-the-business-mindset, as such,
when we think about the future we aspire to work on projects we enjoy with
people we enjoy spending time with. This is a shift from the business
status-quo of outlining growth in terms of the people employed or the
revenue earned. 

We focus our efforts on doing business without compromising our value of the
present moment &mdash; No short term compromises for long term gain.

Although we recognise that our actions now impact where we are as a business
in the future, whatever path we take to get to the future, we should be
present and enjoy <i>every</i> step, not just the final one.

2. **Adaptation over growth**

We believe it is important to  aim to fit in, in harmony, with the existing
people and businesses around us. Our aim is to intergrate with, add to and
support our nearest neighbours, and work outwards and "upwards", collaboratively.

The way to do this is by adapting to what is around, rather than imposing
growth objectives or specific agendas.

We believe in "[starting where we
are](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/815715.Start_Where_You_Are)" and in
making changes in small, incremental steps; in constantly exploring how we are
doing, and making adaptations towards improvement. 

Concretely, we believe that our aim should not be constant growth, or growth
at all costs, but rather incremental adaptations based on diagnosis (see item
4, below). 

A necessary part of adaptation is the willingness to change approaches; drop
old ideas, identify mistakes and adjust course. All of this comes about via
the process of diagnosis.


3. **Local focus over big goals**

We believe we are part of a local ecosystem and we focus on making changes
upwards that consider our surroundings, and deviate away from the idea of
making prescriptive changes "from the top" downwards. 

We strive to empower and benefit our local community. When we do things, we
consider how well these match the needs of the people and businesses who are
in our ecosystem. The focus of our business, is therefore, driven by what is
around it, and who engages with us.

We believe in [making smaller investments pursuing different ideas, than
significant investments in just one or two
ideas](https://silky.github.io/posts/2018-11-09-quick-note-on-budgeting.html).
This allows our growth to be organic and adaptive. Investing this way
reinforces a local focus and is constrainted by the process of diagnosis (see
next item.)


4. **Diagnosis over plans**

We believe in incremental change, and to make it, we believe in periodically
diagnosing where we are, what impact we are having and what needs attention.
These incremental changes <i>are</i> our plan; it is, if you will, "the plan
of no plan".

We evaluate our business on different axes, and we follow the concept
of "patterns" (see "[The Timeless Way of Building](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106728.The_Timeless_Way_of_Building)"
and "[A Pattern Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language)"
by Christopher Alexander and collaborators).

This process of diagnosis is developed in [The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment).

These patterns are the essential elements of the business &mdash; they are
measurable, and as such we can adapt over time, to create better agreement
with the patterns.  In this way we can adapt to changing environments.
Patterns and diagnosis are, then, a useful tool for addressing problems and
areas that need focus.

The patterns for Braneshop, and how to evaluate a business using them, will be
the subject of the third post in this series.


5. **Stakeholders over shareholders**

We are interested in our <i>stakeholders</i> &mdash; the people, businesses,
and systems that are impacted by our actions. We don't focus on shareholders.

We are interested in supporting the environment and people that help us to
live. Our actions have impacts on everyone around us, and thus we need to be
observant of such interactions, and use that information to change what we do.

We use the diagnosis approach to continuously engage the community, and we
need to listen to everyone and adapt based on feedback.

We work on building empathy and understanding with the groups we work with and
interact with.


### Conclusion ... ?

This is a work in progress. 

I want to get feedback on this idea.

I'd love to know if <i>you</i> have any thoughts on this idea.  I'm interested to hear them. You can
reach out to me any time: [noon@braneshop.com.au](mailto:noon@braneshop.com.a).

In the third post, we'll explore the "patterns" for the Braneshop.
